# Changelog

## 2026-04-10

### dev-workflow v1.25.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.25.0

- refactor(dev-workflow): Remove completion hooks prompt from `--init`
  - `--init` no longer asks about hooks — hooks are left unconfigured by default
  - Users can still configure `hooks.on_complete` manually in settings files (execution mode Step 10 unchanged)

### dev-workflow v1.24.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.24.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add 3-layer configuration with type-aware merge
  - New project shared settings file: `.claude/dev-workflow.md` (git tracked, team-shared)
  - Settings are merged across three layers: user global (`~/.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`) → project shared (`.claude/dev-workflow.md`) → personal override (`.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`)
  - Merge strategy: scalar keys are replaced by higher layer; list keys (`check_commands`) are appended and deduplicated; `hooks` is deep-merged (`on_complete` list is appended). `null`/empty explicitly clears the key
  - `--init` now saves to `.claude/dev-workflow.md` (project shared) instead of `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`
  - Existing `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md` continues to work as the highest-priority personal override layer — no migration needed
  - Personal overrides (`.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`) are created manually with only the keys to override

### dev-workflow v1.23.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.23.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add `task_decomposition` setting to disable auto-decomposition in Normal sub-mode
  - Default `true` — existing behavior unchanged
  - Set to `false` to skip Step 1.5's auto-decomposition check entirely — Normal sub-mode requests (`/dev-workflow <task>`) are treated as single tasks. Step 1.5 is omitted from TodoWrite in this mode
  - `--resume <state-file>` is unaffected — existing state files can still be resumed explicitly
  - Non-boolean values fall back to `true` with a warning
- docs(dev-workflow): Refactor SKILL.md for skill-creator best practices
  - Step 1.5 Task Decomposition detail extracted to `references/task-decomposition.md` — SKILL.md drops from 306 to 254 lines (~17% reduction), and simple single-concern runs no longer load state-file semantics they don't need (progressive disclosure)
  - Step 3 / Step 8 `MUST continue re-review` reframed with the *why* (plan modifications often introduce fresh ripple effects; code fixes routinely introduce new bugs) so the instruction persuades instead of insisting
  - No runtime behavior change — all semantics preserved, just documented differently

## 2026-04-09

### dev-workflow v1.22.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.22.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add task decomposition for splitting large tasks into PR-sized subtasks
  - New **Step 1.5: Task Decomposition** runs between Step 1 (Load Settings) and Step 2 (Create Plan)
  - In Normal sub-mode, the workflow lightweightly judges whether the request should be split and proposes a decomposition to the user for approval. Simple, single-concern tasks pass through unchanged
  - Approved decompositions are persisted to `.claude/plans/dev-workflow.<slug>.md` — one state file per parent task, so multiple parent tasks can proceed in parallel
  - Each subtask runs through the existing Step 2–10 flow as an independent PR-sized unit
  - New `--resume <state-file>` flag picks up the next runnable subtask in a fresh session. Accepts full path, filename, or bare slug
  - On subtask completion, the workflow instructs the user to commit + open a PR before resuming the next subtask. The workflow itself never stages, commits, or pushes
  - Parent-task progress is surfaced as a TodoWrite top-level row (`Parent task: N/TOTAL subtasks done — <slug>`)
  - Edge cases handled: YAML parse errors on state files, `depends_on` cycles, missing `--resume` targets, and leftover `in_progress` subtasks from interrupted sessions
  - Step 1.5 is intentionally separate from Plan Mode (which is still reserved for Step 2) so the decomposition proposal is a plain yes/no dialogue

## 2026-04-07

### dev-workflow v1.21.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.21.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add automatic review iteration adjustment based on task difficulty
  - Assesses task difficulty (Simple/Moderate/Complex) after plan creation in Step 2
  - Reduces review iteration count (N) for simpler tasks — configured value acts as ceiling, not target
  - Simple tasks (typo fix, config tweak): N=1, Moderate (single-module multi-file): N=min(2,N), Complex: keep N
  - Explicit `-i N` / `--iterations N` CLI flag skips difficulty assessment (user override)
  - Excess TodoWrite iteration items (Step 3-x, Step 8-x) marked as completed when N is reduced

### All plugins (patch version bump)

- fix: Isolate plugin source directories to prevent duplicate skill registration
  - Each plugin now has its own `plugins/<name>/` source directory with symlinks to `skills/`
  - Previously all plugins shared `source: "./"`, causing Claude Code to auto-discover all skills for every plugin
  - Workaround for [anthropics/claude-code#13344](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13344)
- docs: Update CLAUDE.md to reflect new plugin structure and skill addition flow

## 2026-04-06

### dev-workflow v1.20.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.20.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add `custom_instructions` configuration for injecting user-defined development instructions
  - Free-form string applied to planning (Step 2), plan review (Step 3), implementation (Step 5), simplify (Step 6), and code review (Step 8)
  - Configured via `dev-workflow.local.md` YAML frontmatter
  - `.claude/rules/` and explicit user requests take precedence over `custom_instructions`

### dev-workflow v1.19.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.19.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add hooks configuration for executing skills/commands at workflow timing points
  - `hooks.on_complete`: runs after Step 9 (Update Rules), before completion report
  - Entry format: `Skill(<name>)` for skill invocation, or shell command string
  - Non-blocking: hook failures are reported as warnings in completion summary
  - Configured via `dev-workflow.local.md` YAML frontmatter
- feat(dev-workflow): Add Step 10 (Completion Hooks) to workflow execution
- feat(dev-workflow --init): Add hooks configuration step to project setup flow

## 2026-04-04

### merge-rules v2.0.0 / apply-rules v2.0.0 / extract-rules v1.11.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.3

**Breaking change**: Promoted patterns are now converted to Principles format and integrated into `## Principles`. The `## Project-specific patterns` section is no longer produced by merge-rules. Existing merge-rules output with `## Project-specific patterns` must be regenerated by re-running merge-rules.

- feat(merge-rules): Promote .local.md patterns to Principles format (`Description (signature)`) instead of separate `## Project-specific patterns` section
- feat(merge-rules): Add deduplication against existing Principles to prevent self-amplification from previously promoted patterns in `.local.md`
- feat(merge-rules): Promoted pattern examples are included under `## Principles Examples` (no more `## Project-specific Examples` in output)
- feat(merge-rules): Design note clarifying promoted Principles are permanent org-level rules
- feat(apply-rules): Clean up promoted patterns from `.local.md` files (cross-format duplicate removal)
- feat(apply-rules): Remove corresponding `## Project-specific Examples` entries for cleaned-up patterns
- feat(apply-rules): Delete `.local.md` files that become empty after cleanup
- remove(apply-rules): Remove promoted→`.local.md` routing (promoted patterns are now regular Principles)
- feat(extract-rules): Add cross-format duplicate check in Update mode (Step U4) and Conversation mode to prevent re-adding patterns already promoted to Principles
- refactor: Simplify skill descriptions for merge-rules, apply-rules, and extract-rules to reduce context overhead

### extract-rules v1.10.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.2 (earlier today)

- feat: Remove default size limits from `extract_session_messages.mjs` — all messages included by default
  - `--max-chars` and `--max-per-message` are now optional (default: no limit)
  - Previously defaulted to 100K chars / 2000 chars per message

## 2026-04-03

### extract-rules v1.10.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.1

- feat: `--from-conversation` mode reads full session history from `.jsonl` files on disk
  - No longer limited to context window — captures all messages including those lost to compaction
  - Session file located via encoded project path under `~/.claude/projects/`
  - Supports `<session-id>` argument to target a specific session (default: latest by mtime)
- feat: Delegate heavy processing to subagent to keep main context clean
  - Main agent handles settings + session file resolution (C1-C2)
  - Subagent handles jsonl parsing, analysis, rule extraction, and file writing (C3-C5)
  - Subagent instructions moved to `references/conversation-mode.md` (progressive disclosure)
- feat: Bundle Node.js script `scripts/extract_session_messages.mjs` for jsonl parsing
  - Filters user/assistant text messages, skips tool_use/thinking blocks
  - Recovers `AskUserQuestion` responses via interactive tool ID whitelist
  - Latest-first processing with configurable size limits (100K chars default)
  - Input validation, malformed JSON line diagnostics
- refactor: Replace `Bash(python3 *)` with `Bash(node *)` in allowed-tools (node is guaranteed by Claude Code)
- fix: Update `references/pr-review-mode.md` Step C4 → C5 reference

### dev-workflow v1.18.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.0

- feat: Improve init-mode run-tests generation for autonomous test execution
  - Add Docker daemon readiness check as prerequisite when docker-compose is detected (daemon → services, two-step)
  - Detect existing run-tests skills lacking Docker daemon check and offer regeneration
  - Support `.yaml` extension variants for docker-compose detection
  - Generalize run-tests template: category-based prerequisites, technology-agnostic allowed-tools
  - Add async service retry rule in Process section (re-check with retries for up to 30 seconds)
  - Align pseudo-execute flow with async retry rule

## 2026-04-02

### rules-review v1.0.0

### dev-workflow v1.17.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.17.0

- feat: Add Step 7.5 (Rules Compliance Review) as dedicated rules enforcement step
  - Runs `Skill(rules-review)` between Check/Test (Step 7) and Code Review (Step 8)
  - 2-cycle max: fix violations → re-verify → escalate to user if unresolved
  - Step 8 re-run after code modifications includes Step 7.5
  - Step 8 retains lightweight rules check as safety net
- feat: Bundle `rules-review` skill with `dev-workflow-bundle` plugin

## 2026-04-01

### dev-workflow v1.16.0

- feat: Strengthen rules compliance checking and test coverage verification
  - Step 2: Require specific test files (existing to update or new to create) in test plan, not just abstract descriptions
  - Step 3: Plan reviewer verifies specific test files are identified and existing related tests are covered for update; read all files under `.claude/rules/`
  - Step 8: Reviewer must read all files under `.claude/rules/` and verify compliance against the diff, citing rule file path and violated rule text
  - Step 8: Verify planned test files from Step 2 are present in the diff

### dev-workflow v1.15.1

- fix: Ensure re-review after modifications in Plan Review (Step 3) and Code Review (Step 8)
  - If plan/code was modified based on review feedback, MUST continue to next iteration for re-review
  - If all points were rejected (no modifications), remaining iterations can be skipped
  - Step 8: Consolidate "Re-run Step 7" and "re-review required" under single "code was modified" branch

### dev-workflow v1.15.0

- fix: Strengthen plan approval flow to prevent premature user approval before plan review
  - Step 2: Explicitly forbid presenting plan or asking for approval/confirmation (bold + caps emphasis)
  - Step 3: Add internal review declaration — do not present plan to user during review iterations
  - Step 4: Add `(USER APPROVAL GATE)` to heading, mark as first time user sees the plan
  - Step 4: Add re-review condition — return to Step 3 with new iteration item if user requests material scope/approach changes
  - Step 4: Require explicit user acceptance before proceeding

### apply-rules v1.1.0

- feat: Add `AskUserQuestion` to `allowed-tools` for explicit user confirmation at decision points
  - Step 4 (Integration proposals): batched list with `all / none / number` selection
  - Step 5.5 (File name normalization): confirm renames before applying
  - Step 6 (Principle conflicts): collect all conflicts, present together with `1a, 2c` format
  - Step 7 (Non-conforming files): migration plan as single list, `project.*` excluded from "all"
- feat: Update Conflict Handling table to reflect all `AskUserQuestion` usage points

## 2026-03-31

### apply-rules v1.0.0

- feat: New skill to apply organization-wide rules (merge-rules output) to any project
  - Source specification via GitHub URL or local path (direct path to rules directory)
  - Auto-detect project tech stack (languages, frameworks, integrations) to filter relevant rules
  - Intelligent merge: `.md` (Principles) merged, `.local.md` preserved, promoted patterns routed to `.local.md`
  - Integration proposal: suggest unused but related integration rules for user approval
  - Structure conformance check: migrate non-conforming rule files with user confirmation
  - Fetch from GitHub via `gh api` (no git clone authentication issues)
  - Dry-run mode for previewing changes

## 2026-03-30

### dev-workflow v1.14.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.14.0

- fix: Embed check_commands/test_commands values in TodoWrite Step 7 description to prevent context loss
  - Step 7 registered as `Step 7: Check / Test [check: {check_commands} | test: {test_commands}]`
  - Settings values stay visible through TodoWrite progress checks, reducing risk of AI forgetting commands mid-workflow

### dev-workflow v1.13.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.13.0

- feat: Add test prerequisites check & setup to `run-tests` skill template
  - Auto-detect prerequisites from project files (docker-compose.yml, database.yml, .env.example, bin/setup)
  - Prerequisites section added to generated `run-tests` only when detected
  - Check prerequisites → setup if needed → spawn subagent for test execution; setup failure reports EXECUTION_ERROR with remediation
  - `allowed-tools` in generated skill dynamically includes prerequisite commands
- fix: Use pseudo-execution for `--init` verification step (resolves unregistered skill issue in same session)
  - Read generated SKILL.md and execute test commands directly instead of calling `Skill(run-tests)`
  - Prerequisites checks also run during pseudo-execution
- docs: Add session note — skills generated by `--init` are recognized from the next session onward

### dev-workflow v1.12.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.12.0

- feat: Subagent-based test execution to reduce main context consumption
  - `--init` generates canonical `run-tests` skill with Agent-based subagent execution
  - All test execution goes through `Skill(run-tests)` — no more direct shell commands or arbitrary skill names
  - Subagent returns structured summary (SUCCESS / TEST_FAILED / EXECUTION_ERROR) instead of raw test output
  - Includes stack trace excerpts and code locations for failures — enough to fix without re-running
  - Scope decision delegated to `run-tests` skill via `--base-commit <sha>` argument
  - Existing `run-tests` in current format is reused; outdated format is automatically regenerated (test commands are preserved)
- docs: Add `run-tests` SKILL.md template to `references/init-mode.md`

### dev-workflow v1.11.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.11.0

- feat: Add `review_iterations` default value (3) to `--init` generated config file
- feat: Add verification step after `--init` config creation
  - Run check_commands and test_commands to verify they work
  - `Skill()` entries: select a test file and invoke the skill, or run minimum test scope
  - Report pass/fail summary; failures suggest fixes but do not block

## 2026-03-28

### dev-workflow v1.10.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.10.0

- feat: Enhance `--init` test_commands detection with test skill auto-detection and generation
  - Detect existing test skills in `.claude/skills/` (e.g., `test-file`, `run-tests`) and propose `Skill(<name>)`
  - Auto-generate `run-tests` skill when 3+ distinct test scopes detected (with overwrite protection)
  - Fall back to direct commands for 1-2 test scopes, or project-type standard commands
- refactor: Extract Init Mode instructions to `references/init-mode.md` for progressive disclosure

### dev-workflow v1.9.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.9.0

- feat: Make review iteration count configurable (default: 3, positive integer)

  - Add `-i N` / `--iterations N` command option for per-invocation override
  - Priority: `-i` / `--iterations` option > config `review_iterations` > default `3`
  - Step 1: Dynamically generate N iteration sub-items for TodoWrite registration
  - Steps 3/8: Process N pending iteration items instead of hardcoded 3

### dev-workflow v1.8.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.8.0

- feat: Improve plan approval flow — reviewer reviews the plan before user approval
  - Step 2: Add instruction to proceed directly to Step 3 without asking user for approval
  - Step 4: Add explicit user approval flow (present → collaborate → accept → ExitPlanMode)
  - Step 3: Carry unresolved review points forward to Step 4 instead of asking user mid-review

### peer v2.2.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.7.1

- feat: Add autonomous parallel review — when a review request contains multiple independent categories, ask-peer spawns one subagent per category in parallel and merges results

## 2026-03-27

### dev-workflow v1.7.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.7.0

- feat: Add test review perspectives to plan creation, plan review, and code review
  - Step 2: Require test plan in implementation plan (what to test, test types, scope — or why no tests are needed)

  - Add `MANDATORY, DO NOT SKIP` marker to Step 8 header
  - Structure review request into 3 categories (Correctness, Conventions, Simplicity)
  - Add iteration status tracking via TodoWrite in Step 8
- fix: Change review loop condition from "code modified" to "actionable feedback remains"

  - `language` setting now only affects rule content (Good/Bad examples, descriptions) and reports
- refactor: Unify `## Common patterns` into `## Project-specific patterns` in merge-rules output
  - Eliminates separate section for promoted patterns — input/output section names now match
  - Simplifies re-merging of merge-rules output

### extract-rules v1.9.0

- feat: Add `.examples.md` generation for Good/Bad code examples per rule category
  - Separate from rule files (no `paths:` frontmatter) — not auto-loaded into context

### extract-rules v1.7.0

- feat: Reframe extraction criteria around "Claude's knowledge gap"
  - Core question changed from "Is this project-specific?" to "Would Claude produce something different without this rule?"
  - Anti-pattern extraction added (things Claude would naturally do that the team has rejected)
- feat: Add staleness check in `--update` mode
  - Verifies referenced symbols in `.local.md` still exist in codebase

### extract-rules v1.4.0

- feat: Add `--restructure` option for file structure reorganization with content merge
  - Re-analyzes codebase to determine optimal file structure
  - Merges existing rules into new structure (preserves manual edits and conversation-extracted rules)
  - Existing rules take priority over fresh extraction on conflict (respects manual edits)
  - Shows restructure plan for user confirmation before execution
  - Handles split_output mode transitions (hybrid ↔ split)
  - Unmatched rules fall back to project.md
- **breaking**: Change `split_output` default from `false` to `true` (Principles and Project-specific patterns are now separated by default)
- remove: `--force` option (use `rm -rf .claude/rules/ && /extract-rules` or `--restructure` instead)
- refactor: Extract report templates to `references/report-templates.md` (progressive disclosure)
- refactor: Simplify Restructure Mode steps (R1-R6 → R1-R5, concise descriptions)

## 2026-03-02

### extract-rules v1.3.0

- feat: Add `split_output` option for `.local.md` file separation (opt-in)
  - `split_output: false` (default): Single hybrid file per category (backwards compatible)
  - `split_output: true`: Principles → `<name>.md` (portable), Project-specific patterns → `<name>.local.md` (local)
  - Classification is mechanical: `## Principles` → shared file, `## Project-specific patterns` → local file
  - `project.md` is never split (inherently project-specific)
- feat: Add layered framework support (Rails, Django, Spring, etc.)
  - Detect architectural layers (e.g., models, controllers, views) when directories exist
  - Generate layer-specific files with scoped `paths:` (e.g., `rails-model.md`)
  - Cross-layer rules in `<framework>.md` (no `paths:` or broad scope)
- feat: Handle orphaned `.local.md` files when switching split modes
  - `--force`: Warns and deletes orphaned `.local.md` files
  - `--update`: Warns and recommends running `--force` to clean up
- refactor: Extract classification criteria to `references/extraction-criteria.md`
  - Progressive disclosure: metadata → SKILL.md body → bundled references
- refactor: Remove `Bash(grep *)` from allowed-tools (use Grep tool instead)
- docs: Enhanced skill description for better trigger matching
