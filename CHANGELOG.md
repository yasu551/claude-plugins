### dev-workflow v1.34.10 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.10

- feat(dev-workflow): emit Producer version line in self-retrospective issue body
  - Category: missing-branch; Retrospective issue bodies carried no record of which `dev-workflow` version produced them, leaving the triage routine unable to distinguish stale issues (already-fixed in a later release) from current ones. Added a `**Producer version:** dev-workflow v<X.Y.Z>` line directly under the body header in `references/self-retrospective.md` § 4 Assemble — resolved from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` via `jq` with a literal `unknown` fallback when the file or entry is missing. Consumer-side stale-issue handling (regex extract, version-aware reject path with `(i)` CHANGELOG entry + `(ii)` SKILL.md cite gates and either-leg doubt fall-through to standard checklist) lives in the project-local `dev-workflow-triage` skill, where it can evolve independently of the bundle.

## 2026-05-05

### dev-workflow v1.34.9 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.9

- fix(dev-workflow): add Step 3 Plan Review return-point no-stall reminder mirroring Step 8 (auto-triage #13)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3's iteration loop lacked the inline `Return-point no-stall reminder` bullet that Step 8 already carries, so the no-stall discipline only fired via the abstract `§ No-Stall Principle` section, not at the decision moment. Added a sibling-mirrored reminder that enumerates reviewer outcomes as a closed-list and names case-specific next actions, with stable cross-reference to `§ No-Stall Principle`.

### dev-workflow v1.34.8 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.8

- feat(dev-workflow): add user-gate summary preamble convention to Step 4 / Step 7.5 / Step 8
  - Category: ambiguity; The three user-judgment gates presented structured content without a TL;DR layer, leaving users to scan the full structured content before forming an overall picture. Added a `§ User-gate summary preamble` section to `references/plan-format.md` and one-line references from each of the three gate steps in `SKILL.md`.

## 2026-05-03

### dev-workflow v1.34.7 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.7

- fix(dev-workflow): add post-Critical-fix class-level extension audit to Step 8 iteration loop (auto-triage #12)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 8 step 3 had no explicit instruction to scan the rest of the diff for instances of the same defect class after a Critical-severity fix, leaving fixes scoped to the single named instance even when the class spanned the diff. Added an inline self-audit bullet sequenced before the modified-vs-rejected branches, with same-defect-class characterization (same operation / broken assumption / side-effect pattern) and concrete examples in parentheses.
- fix(dev-workflow): augment plan-format Step 2 self-check with promotion cues for buried Decisions (auto-triage #12)
  - Category: wrong-default; The buried-decisions checkbox previously gave no concrete cue for spotting a Design-buried judgment, so author self-check rarely caught what Step 3 external review later flagged. Added a closed-list of three promotion cues (why-X-over-Y / fixed-value-or-timing rationale, new enum without per-member necessity, (a)+(b)-passing choice missing an Alternative line) that operationalize the (a)+(b) criterion at detection time.

## 2026-05-02

### dev-workflow v1.34.6 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.6

- fix(dev-workflow): cover new-component alignment direction in Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #11)
  - Category: missing-branch; The Step 2 Simplicity self-audit's `Cross-component structural-blast-radius` bullet only covered the "propagate fix outward" direction; the symmetric "align new component inward" branch was absent, surfacing late as Step 3 reviewer or Step 4 user pushback. Renamed to `Cross-component pattern alignment` and rewrote to audit both alignment directions explicitly, with skill-development examples kept in parentheses.
- fix(dev-workflow): add consistency-with-siblings rationale check to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #11)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 2 Simplicity self-audit had no branch for plan elements whose primary rationale is "align with existing sibling implementations / for consistency" alone, leaving lighter alternatives unsurfaced and divergence-cost notes implicit. Added a new bullet that triggers on this rationale, requires lighter alternatives in parallel in Decisions, and requires a one-line cost-of-divergence record when consistency is chosen.

## 2026-05-01

### dev-workflow v1.34.5 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.5

- fix(dev-workflow): add Distribution-aware fix direction guidance to retrospective producer §3 Sanitization to prevent skill-development vocabulary leak into bundle skills' SKILL.md prose (subtask 2 of meta-scope-leak)
  - Category: wrong-default; The producer's §3 "Keep as-is" line allowed `suggested fix directions expressed in skill-level vocabulary` by default. The triage applier transcribes those directions mostly verbatim into target SKILL.md prose, so skill-development vocabulary leaked into bundle skills' user-visible distribution surface. Added a `§ Distribution-aware fix direction (bundle skill targets)` sub-section requiring abstract-principle-first phrasing with skill-development examples in parens when the target is one of the bundle skills and the fix lands in SKILL.md / references prose. The corresponding source-of-truth rule was added to `.claude/rules/project.rules.md` § SKILL.md の配布性 with a Good/Bad example in `.claude/rules/project.rules.examples.md`.
- chore(release): synchronize dev-workflow and dev-workflow-bundle plugin versions to v1.34.5 (dev-workflow +2 jump from v1.34.3, dev-workflow-bundle +1 from v1.34.4 — pair-bump alignment)

### ask-peer v2.2.3 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.4

- fix(ask-peer): generalize peer reviewer "operational reality" prompt to remove skill-bundle internal vocabulary (subtask 1 of meta-scope-leak)
  - Category: wrong-default; The peer personality "Planning" focus area inherited `subagent dispatch and time budgets` / `sub-dispatches` from auto-triage #6, which defaulted to skill-bundle internal vocabulary instead of language-agnostic wording. These tokens confuse general-purpose project reviewers. Replaced with `compute and time budgets` / `operations`; the `N × M` sanity-check example survives.

## 2026-04-30

### ask-peer v2.2.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.3

- fix(ask-peer): add numerical self-consistency and operational-reality observations to plan review (auto-triage #6)
  - Category: missing-branch; Plan reviews missed (i) numerical off-by-one between plan body counts and TodoWrite reality, and (ii) the operational feasibility of upper-bound limits given subagent dispatch overhead. Extended the Planning focus area in the peer-personality block to enumerate both observations.

### dev-workflow v1.34.3 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.3

- fix(dev-workflow): make ExitPlanMode precondition explicit at Step 4 step 3 (auto-triage #7)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 3 → Step 4 ordering invariant was implicit; agent could issue `ExitPlanMode` mid-Step-3. Step 4 step 3 now names the TodoWrite precondition and the remediation when it trips.
- fix(dev-workflow): add cross-skill structural-blast-radius bullet to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #7)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 2 self-audit only covered intra-plan incrementality. New bullet requires explicit scope expansion or a Risks-entry deferral when sibling skills share the same structural pattern.
- fix(dev-workflow): add cross-file consistency check to Step 3 (f) rubric (auto-triage #7)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 3 (f) covered cross-section consistency within a single plan but not cross-file consistency across multiple SKILL.md / references files. New bullet sits beside the existing cross-section check, gated on multi-file plans.
- fix(dev-workflow): add inline no-stall reminder at Step 8 iteration boundary (auto-triage #6)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 8 iteration boundaries had no inline no-stall reminder, so the agent stalled between iter k and iter k+1. Reminder enumerates reviewer outcomes in closed-list form and names the three possible next actions, all gated to "next tool call".
- fix(dev-workflow): add Simplify-revival check to Step 8 reviewer category c (auto-triage #5)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 8 review fix cycle could silently re-introduce narration that Step 6 Simplify deliberately removed. New clause in category c. (iter k ≥ 2 only) tells the reviewer to flag that regression class.
- fix(dev-workflow): require recording cycle-to-cycle judgment drift in Step 7.5 (auto-triage #5)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 7.5 1st/2nd cycle verdicts could legitimately differ on the same location, but the SKILL.md never required recording the reason. New clause in step 3.c covers both drift directions and requires the reason in the audit trail before completion.

### extract-rules v1.13.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.3

- fix(extract-rules): clarify examples-format reference direction is one-way (auto-triage #5)
  - Category: wrong-default; Examples-file generation defaulted to emitting a self-reference link at the end because the format spec did not state the reference direction explicitly. New clause forbids self-links and binds templates / subagent prompts to omit the section.

### rules-review v1.1.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.3

- fix(rules-review): add explicit scope policy to reviewer prompt (auto-triage #5)
  - Category: ambiguity; Reviewer prompt did not state whether rules apply diff-only or file-wide. New "Scope" clause makes diff-only the default, with an explicit escape when the rule text demands file-wide consistency.

### extract-rules v1.13.1

- docs(extract-rules): Translate remaining Japanese comments in the Usage block to English
  - The `/extract-rules --from-pr` examples in `## Usage` carried Japanese comments (`カレントリポのPR指定`, `他リポのPR指定（URL形式も可）`, `範囲指定（カレントリポ）`, `範囲指定（他リポ）`, `複数指定可（スペース区切り）→ 横断分析で組織重視の原則を検出`). Project rules require distributed artifacts (SKILL.md included) to be in English; the comments now read `PR in current repo`, `PR in another repo (URL form also accepted)`, `PR range (current repo)`, `PR range (another repo)`, and `Multiple specs allowed (space-separated) → cross-analysis detects org-wide principles`. No behavioral change

### dev-workflow v1.34.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.2

- fix(dev-workflow): Require repo-wide grep before drafting plans for version/identifier string replacement tasks
  - Step 2 sub-step 3 gains a new bullet: when the core operation is replacing a specific version string, identifier, or constant across the project (e.g. version bump, rename, migration), grep the entire repository for the old value before drafting the plan and enumerate the complete list of affected files in the Design section. Missing even one location is the primary regression source for this task class — surfacing the full target set at plan time blocks the "we forgot a place" failure mode rather than catching it at Step 7
- fix(dev-workflow): Require pinned-dependency compatibility verification on runtime/language major-version upgrades
  - Step 3 sub-step 1 (a) Scope & feasibility gains: when the plan proposes upgrading the base runtime or language major version, the reviewer must verify that all pinned dependencies (runtime and dev) explicitly cover the new version. Any dependency whose supported range does not include the new version must be flagged, and the plan must adopt the most conservative version all pinned dependencies safely support rather than leaving compatibility gaps for the user to catch at Step 4
- fix(dev-workflow): Add a Scope-drift guard around `check_commands` so auto-fix writes outside the task scope are surfaced instead of silently accepted
  - Step 7 sub-step 1 gains a "Scope-drift guard" bullet: before each command, record `git diff --name-only <base-commit>` as the task-scope snapshot. After the command, re-check the diff — any file newly appearing outside that snapshot was written by the command (auto-fix/write behavior sweeping unrelated drift). On detection, warn the user (listing both the in-scope files and the newly-appeared out-of-scope files), do **not** auto-revert / `git checkout` / delete the out-of-scope changes (leave the working tree as the command left it for user inspection), leave `Step 7: Check / Test` as `in_progress`, and wait for user direction. Positioned as the only allowed non-completing exit from the check_commands phase
  - The `## No-Stall Principle` enumeration adds **Step 7 scope-drift stop** as a new permissible pause point alongside the existing entries (Step 1.5 dialogues, Step 4 plan approval, Step 7 fail-stop, Step 7.5 persisting violations, Step 8 unresolved findings, Completion subtask PR URL prompt). Required by the section's own "update the enumeration and the definition together" invariant — a pause point introduced only in the Step 7 definition would have left the closed-list claim false

### dev-workflow v1.34.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.1

- fix(dev-workflow): Extend the `language` config scope to cover all user-facing prose the skill produces, not just Step 9.5
  - `language` now governs the Step 4 plan body (Overview / Decisions / Design / Test plan / Risks / Unknowns content) and the Step 2 difficulty-assessment log in addition to the Step 9.5 finding `Description` / `Suggested fix direction` paragraphs. Previously a Japanese user still received an English plan in Step 4 even though the rest of the conversation was Japanese
  - Plan section headings (`Overview` / `Decisions` / `Design` / `Test plan` / `Risks` / `Unknowns`), the Step 4 literal guidance line, and the Step 9.5 schema tokens / terminal summary / destination header remain English regardless of the setting so the template-contract and machine-checkable strings stay load-bearing
  - `## Configuration` entry rewritten to enumerate the three covered surfaces; Step 2 sub-step 7 and Step 4 sub-step 1 explicitly instruct writing the difficulty log and plan body prose in the resolved language
- fix(dev-workflow): Forbid non-template sections in the plan via a new Step 2 self-check bullet
  - `references/plan-format.md` § Step 2 self-check gains: "No section appears outside the enumerated template (Overview, Decisions, Design, Test plan, optionally Risks / Unknowns) — added 'meta' sections such as introductions, methodology notes, or recap blocks belong inside Design or should be dropped entirely". Header wording updated from "run this check on the Decisions section" to "run this check on the plan" to reflect the expanded scope; the trailing paragraph restates the template's required-headings list as the closed set of sections and the only structural property checked here
- fix(dev-workflow): Close Step 2 sub-step 8 against confirmation-seeking transition phrases
  - Step 2 sub-step 8 now explicitly forbids confirmation-seeking transition sentences such as "if this design looks good, I'll proceed to Step 3 (Plan Review)" or "shall I move on to Plan Review?" — they superficially read as natural conversation but constitute the same approval gate the step already prohibits and waste user attention on an unreviewed plan. The moment Step 2 ends, the workflow must advance to Step 3 without emitting any user-facing message about the plan or the transition
- fix(dev-workflow): Close Step 8 short-circuit rationalizations when re-running Step 7 / Step 7.5 after a fix
  - Step 8 iteration-loop sub-step 3 now mandates "Always re-run Step 7 and Step 7.5 — no exceptions" and explicitly disallows the common rationalizations: confidence in the fix, small diff size, modified paths that appear out of scope for the configured `check_commands` / `test_commands` (e.g. edits landing entirely under a local-skill directory or a docs-only path), or the re-run "would be a no-op". A genuine no-op outcome is the audit trail; skipping the re-run removes the trail. The only permissible skip remains the separate branch where no code was modified in the iteration

### dev-workflow v1.34.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Submit Step 9.5 repo-mode retrospectives via `gh api` instead of `gh issue create` to run with the minimum GitHub token permissions
  - `references/self-retrospective.md` § 4 Submit repo mode step 2 now invokes `gh api --method POST /repos/<feedback>/issues -f title=... -F body=@<staging-file>`. `gh api` only needs a token with `Issues: write` on the target repo, whereas `gh issue create` additionally requires broader read scopes for label/assignee metadata lookups — switching narrows the blast radius of a leaked token
  - `allowed-tools` in `SKILL.md` replaces `Bash(gh issue create *)` with `Bash(gh api --method POST /repos/*/issues *)` — pinned to the issue-creation endpoint so other `POST /repos/{o}/{r}/...` paths that carry higher blast radius (webhooks, deploy keys, `dispatches`, git refs/commits, repo transfer, releases) are NOT pre-approved. The two wildcards cover `<owner>/<repo>` in the URL and the trailing `-f title=... -F body=@<file>` flags. The § 5 "gh submission failure" retry hint and the README destination table / prerequisites entry are updated to the new invocation and call out the reduced token-scope requirement
- feat(dev-workflow): Delete the Step 9.5 repo-mode staging file after a successful submission, preserve it on failure
  - `references/self-retrospective.md` § 4 Submit repo mode gains sub-step 3: after the `gh api` POST returns exit 0, `rm` the staging file `.claude/plans/retrospective-<slug>.md`. On non-zero exit the file is left in place as a retry affordance — § 5 "gh submission failure" now surfaces the preserved path and a full `gh api` retry command
  - Path mode unchanged (the written file is the user-facing deliverable in that mode). The path-mode bullet now explicitly notes the no-delete behavior so the mode asymmetry is visible at a glance

## 2026-04-23

### dev-workflow v1.33.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.33.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add configurable output language for Step 9.5 finding prose
  - New top-level scalar config key `language` (e.g. `ja`, `en`), merged across the three settings layers like other scalars. Resolution: merged skill config → `~/.claude/settings.json` `language` field → default `ja`. `null` / empty string / non-string values fall through to the next step. Reading `~/.claude/settings.json` warns only on malformed JSON or an invalid `language` value; a missing file or missing key silently falls through to `ja`
  - Scope: only the `Description` / `Suggested fix direction` paragraphs of Step 9.5 findings honor the setting. Everything else — schema tokens (`### Finding <N>`, labels, enum values, `Findings: <N>`, `Status: ERROR`), terminal summary, destination header — stays English regardless of the setting
  - Step 9.5 threads the resolved language into `references/self-retrospective.md` §2.1 subagent prompt (new `Language` input + new "Language handling" instruction step). §3 sanitization applies to the localized prose regardless of language
  - §5 Machine-checkable rejection contract pinned to English so string/enum matching stays load-bearing. Added a **Contract note — do not relax for i18n** to prevent future editors from "fixing" §5 to accept translated tokens and silently break the main ↔ subagent contract

### dev-workflow v1.32.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.32.1

- fix(dev-workflow): Introduce No-Stall Principle so the workflow never pauses except at explicit user-gate points
  - New `## No-Stall Principle` section placed at the top of `## Execution Mode`. Enumerates the exhaustive list of permissible pause points (Step 1.5 decomposition dialogue, Step 1.5 Resume picker, Step 4 plan approval, Step 7 after 3 retries, Step 7.5 step 3.d persisting violations, Step 8 step 4 unresolved findings, Completion subtask PR URL prompt). At every other point the agent must treat skill results semantically and proceed automatically — no reliance on exact-phrase matching
  - Step 6 (Simplify): add an explicit completion clause — regardless of whether `Skill(simplify)` applied fixes or returned any other non-error result, mark the step `completed` and proceed to Step 7 automatically. Previously the step had a single sub-step (the skill invocation) with no guidance on handling a no-op return, so the workflow paused until the user said "continue"
  - Step 7.5 (Rules Compliance Review) step 2: replace the exact-phrase list ("No rule violations found", "All rules compliant", …) with a semantic-judgment instruction. The list was fragile because (i) `"All rules compliant"` was never emitted by the current rules-review implementation, and (ii) any future wording change in rules-review would silently break the match. Semantic judgment plus the No-Stall Principle is robust to output-format drift
  - Step 7.5 step 3.c (2nd-cycle re-run after violation fix): make the clean-2nd-cycle branch explicit — reuse the same semantic judgment as step 2 and proceed to Step 8 automatically. Previously only the "violations persist" branch was written, leaving the clean-re-run case without an explicit progress instruction
  - Step 9 (Update Rules): add a closing sub-step — after `Skill(extract-rules)` invocations return, mark the step `completed` and proceed automatically regardless of whether new rules were added or the skill reported nothing changed. Pre-emptive alignment with the No-Stall Principle so Step 9 stays consistent with Steps 6 and 7.5

### dev-workflow v1.32.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.32.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Structured plan format with a mandatory Decisions section to cut Step 4 user-review fatigue
  - New file `references/plan-format.md` — single source of truth for plan structure (Overview / Decisions / Design / Test plan / Risks), the (a)+(b) Decisions criterion, Subtask / Resume handling, the Step 2 self-check, the Step 3 (f) content-quality rubric, and the three literal Step 4 guidance lines
  - Step 2 Create Plan: sub-step 3 now instructs authors to follow the template in `references/plan-format.md`; new sub-step 5 **Plan presentation format self-check** runs the author's first-pass judgment on the (a)+(b) Decisions criterion, and subsequent sub-steps shift forward by one (the difficulty-based N adjustment and "do not present" now sit at sub-steps 7 and 8)
  - Step 3 Plan Review: adds review category **(f) Presentation & attention allocation (content quality)** — external re-check of the Decisions section's content (does each item genuinely pass (a)+(b), is there a judgment call buried in Design, are Overview/Design/Test plan/Decisions mutually consistent). Format compliance is not re-checked here — the Step 2 self-check is authoritative for structure, keeping the division of labor clean and preventing the "No actionable findings" short-circuit from bypassing format validation
  - Step 4 Finalize Plan: sub-step 1 leads with one of three literal English guidance lines (Decisions present / empty-Normal / empty-Resume) drawn verbatim from `references/plan-format.md`. The "Decisions present" variant tells the user where their judgment is actually needed; the empty variants turn "no decisions" into a strong skim-and-approve signal rather than a mistakenly-dropped section
  - README `## Plan format` section: user-facing summary of the template, the Decisions gate, and the recommended review procedure

### dev-workflow v1.31.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.31.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Address plan self-audit and code-review rubric gaps from retrospective-2026-04-22 (findings F1 / F2 code-review-side / F3 planning-side / F4 / F5 code-review-side; see Explicit defers below for what each finding did not cover in this release)
  - Step 2 Simplicity self-audit: added **Root-cause provenance check** — if the plan leans on a root-cause claim from an AI-authored prior-session artifact (inherited spec file, decomposition state file's AI-authored description), re-derive the root cause from the user's original ask before treating it as load-bearing. Previously the audit only flagged inherited design elements; root-cause claims embedded in those drafts could be adopted wholesale and later discovered to be wrong only after the implementation had been built on them
  - Step 2 Simplicity self-audit: added **Plan-level incrementality** as an author-side check. Previously incrementality was only asked at the reviewer level in Step 3.d; concrete plans that bundle independent work (e.g. a new retry primitive + unrelated control-flow refactor) could slip past the author and rely on the reviewer to catch them. Author-side check lets the split be proposed before peer review, reducing rework
  - Step 5 Implement: added a **Respect prior in-session edits** self-discipline — content the user explicitly removed earlier in this session (comments, guards, logs) must not reappear when applying plan steps, Step 6 simplify output, or Step 8 review fixes. Placed on the implementing agent (main) because reviewers/simplify subagents only see `git diff <base-commit>` and cannot detect a user-delete-then-agent-readd cycle whose net diff is zero. Previously the rubric treated "missing rationale" as something to add; that framing caused agents to silently resurrect comments and guards the user had already removed
  - Step 8 Code Review rubric: category **(b) Conventions & consistency** now explicitly treats **comment narration** (line-by-line paraphrase of the code) and **comment preamble** (restating information obvious from the surrounding function/file) as delete-candidates — the default action is removal, not asking the author to expand the rationale. The prior binary "does this comment explain why?" check was too permissive; long narration with one sentence of intent still passed
  - Step 8 Code Review rubric: category **(c) Simplicity & maintainability** now specifically enumerates the speculative-addition patterns that kept resurfacing across review iterations — **defensive hardening of already-safe paths, future-proofing for hypothetical double-calls, and double-coverage over paths already protected elsewhere** — with explicit "default to removal" framing. The prior generic "speculative features without explicit trigger" wording was read as a soft suggestion and routinely ignored in favor of "noting for later"
  - Step 7.5 literal-string match list: added `"No rule violations found"` to the e.g. list so the revised rules-review output (see below) is recognized as a compliant response

- Explicit defers (not implemented in this release):
  - **Finding 2 — Step 6 simplify-side application**: the retrospective's F2 fix direction named both code-review and simplify. This release strengthens Step 8 (code-review) only; the Step 6 simplify invocation is unchanged. Peer review during planning flagged that propagating the same rubric to Step 6 would duplicate responsibility without a distinct enforcement mechanism — `Skill(simplify)` already receives `custom_instructions` as its generic constraint channel. Users who want the speculative-addition / narration-preamble rubric at simplify time should surface it via `custom_instructions`. Revisit if future retrospectives show simplify-stage regressions
  - **Finding 3 — skill self-version staleness warning**: the retrospective's F3 also asked for a startup-time warning when the skill runs with a version older than what's available locally. Deferred as a separate task — dev-workflow itself has no version-read mechanism today, and "is a newer version available?" needs upstream-check infrastructure that's out of scope for a text-level rubric update
  - **Finding 5 — commit-message body scope**: the retrospective's F5 also asked that the same narration/preamble rubric apply to commit-message bodies. Commit authoring is not dev-workflow's responsibility (dev-workflow never stages, commits, or pushes); the Completion step delegates commit creation to the user (or to `hooks.on_complete` skills like `skill-review` / `work-complete`). The rubric should live in whichever skill owns commit authoring, not here

### extract-rules v1.13.0

- feat(extract-rules): Add post-generation Portability check to examples-format reference (retrospective-2026-04-22 finding F6)
  - `references/examples-format.md`: appended a new `## Portability check (post-generation)` section — after writing each example + description, re-read the pair and ask whether the description holds for every call site of the pattern, or leaks assumptions from the specific site it was mined from. Flags two common leaks: (i) **test-file origin** (unit-test samples that describe the pattern in test-isolation terms, which diverge from production semantics when the same pattern appears in production code) and (ii) **specific-site framing** (descriptions that reference local variables / fixture names that don't generalize). Fallback is to add a `test-only` qualifier to the rule title so downstream readers do not apply the rule outside its mined context
  - Applies to all modes (Full Extraction, Update, Restructure, Conversation, PR Review)
  - Also corrected the `## Common Generation Procedure` opening line to list `Restructure` alongside the other modes — the section already has a `### For Full Extraction / Restructure` subheading, but the parenthetical mode list at the top omitted Restructure

### rules-review v1.1.0

- feat(rules-review): Clarify hard-rule vs intent-rule coverage and align output string (retrospective-2026-04-22 finding F7)
  - `description`: appended "Best suited for hard rules (naming, imports, placement, explicit prohibitions); intent-style rules are checked on a best-effort basis." Previously the skill advertised a uniform "rule compliance check" which could be read as full coverage; in practice intent-style rules (comment taste, speculative-addition avoidance) are judgment calls that benefit from dev-workflow's Step 8 code-review in addition to this skill's structural scan
  - Agent prompt (Step 5): tells reviewers that rules may include **hard rules (binary compliance)** and **intent rules (judgment-based)**, to evaluate both, and that low-confidence intent-rule cases must be reported in the violation list with an explicit `low-confidence` marker — the exact "No rule violations found" response is reserved for confidently-clean cases. This preserves the aggregator's exact-string contract (Step 6) while routing borderline intent-rule cases out of the clean path, where the user would otherwise miss them
  - Output string change: `All rules compliant` → `No rule violations found` (single line, both the Step 6 aggregation branch and the Output Format template). Synced with dev-workflow Step 7.5's literal-string match list in the same release so the new string is recognized as compliant by the workflow

Note: `merge-rules` and `apply-rules` are **not** bumped. The output format of extract-rules is unchanged (the new Portability check is a pre-write guideline, not a format change), and rules-review's output string change has no downstream consumer beyond dev-workflow (updated in the same release).

### dev-workflow v1.30.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.30.1

- fix(dev-workflow): Exclude Solution-Style root tsconfig from per-tsconfig type-check registration in `--init`
  - `references/init-mode.md`: when the root `tsconfig.json` has a non-empty `references` array (Solution-Style), the root itself is now excluded from `check_commands`. `tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` typically fails on Solution-Style roots because emit is disabled at the root; only the referenced leaf tsconfigs and other non-root tsconfigs that survive the name-based exclusion get registered. This closes a gap in v1.30.0's multi-tsconfig auto-registration where the generated command list could include a root entry that always errored
- docs(dev-workflow): Clarify Step 1.5 decomposition rationale is a chat message to the user
  - `references/task-decomposition.md`: the one-line rationale is now explicitly a **chat message to the user** — not a TodoWrite note or state-file field. This is the only visible audit trail for the "do NOT decompose" path, since the yes/adjust/no dialogue only fires on the "decompose" path. Without the chat line, negative decomposition decisions left no externally visible record

### extract-rules v1.12.1

- docs(extract-rules): Propagate `paths:` frontmatter from `<name>.md` to `<name>.local.md`, add `## Examples` link in project-specific templates
  - `SKILL.md` Step 6 output structure: `<name>.local.md` now carries the **same `paths:` frontmatter** as its `<name>.md` counterpart, so local project-specific patterns auto-load under the same scope as the portable Principles. Previously only `<name>.md` was documented as having `paths:`, which left `<name>.local.md` effectively unscoped despite being the more context-sensitive of the pair
  - Layer-specific and cross-layer rules about `paths:` now apply uniformly to both `.md` and `.local.md`
  - `## Project-specific patterns` template gains a trailing `## Examples` section pointing to the co-located `.examples.md` file (e.g. `./typescript.examples.md`), so reviewers can jump from a pattern note to runnable Good/Bad samples without guessing the filename

### apply-rules v2.0.2

- fix(apply-rules): Sync `paths:` frontmatter from `.md` to `.local.md` during Step 6b cleanup
  - `.local.md` files generated by extract-rules before v1.12.1 lack `paths:` frontmatter and are effectively unscoped. apply-rules Step 6b now retrofits the scope by copying (union + dedup) the sibling `.md`'s `paths:` onto any `.local.md` that survives the promoted-pattern cleanup. This aligns existing projects with the v1.12.1 contract without requiring a full extract-rules re-run
  - `.local.md` files deleted by the cleanup (emptied) are unaffected — no frontmatter sync is performed on deleted files

Note: `merge-rules` is **not** bumped. merge-rules output contains no `.local.md` (patterns are promoted to Principles), and input `.local.md` frontmatter is already parsed gracefully regardless of whether `paths:` is present.

### dev-workflow v1.30.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.30.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Strengthen Simple classification, add external-library primary-source verification, close multi-tsconfig coverage gap, and open a runtime trigger for examples.md staleness review (retrospective-2026-04-20 findings F1/F2/F3/F4)
  - Step 2.6: Simple escalates to at least Moderate when the change touches an external library's configuration file or type-level API AND that library has had a recent major-version bump. The check is a quick `git diff <base-commit>` on the project's package manifest looking for major version changes. Similar qualitative risks (external config-DSL rewrites, etc.) follow the same rule. Mechanical check + qualitative trigger are combined so stale-config failures after a major upgrade cannot slip through the Simple path
  - Step 3 Plan Review: added a new category (e) **External library primary-source verification** (independent of category (a) so it gets its own reviewer checklist slot). When the plan touches an external library's API, configuration DSL, configuration file, enabled options, or type-level behavior — interpreted broadly so plugin activation and option tweaks count — reviewers must treat in-project references (`.examples.md`, `.local.md`, existing implementations) as secondary and require the plan to cite at least one primary source (installed type definitions, package source, or official reference docs). If the primary source cannot be consulted in the current environment (missing installed deps, no web access), the item is flagged in the plan as a stale-API concern instead of being trusted silently. Step 8 is not changed — the check is scoped to the planning gate to avoid noise at code review
  - Step 7: notes that TypeScript Project References / multi-tsconfig setups can leave changed files uncovered by `check_commands`. `--init` now auto-registers per-tsconfig `tsc -p <path> --noEmit` when 2+ tsconfigs or `references: [...]` are detected. The per-tsconfig form was chosen over `tsc -b --noEmit` because the latter is only supported on TypeScript ≥ 5.6; per-tsconfig `-p` is universally compatible and needs no version probing
  - Step 9: `--update` now additionally triggers when a dependency's major-version bump is detected via `git diff <base-commit>` on the package manifest (same signal as Step 2.6). This opens the runtime path for finding F3 — without this trigger the extract-rules Update Mode operational note was documented but never read in practice, because `--update` only ran on "significant structural/pattern changes"
  - Step 9.5: Simple hard-skip is now overridable by an explicit user request **within the same session** (e.g. "run the retrospective for this run anyway"). The manual re-run runs the `references/self-retrospective.md` procedure from §1 without updating TodoWrite (the Step 9.5 row stays `completed`) and prompts the user to re-verify the session jsonl selection at §1.4. Cross-session re-runs are not supported — once the workflow session has ended, the Step 2.6 difficulty assessment cannot be recovered. `references/self-retrospective.md`:7 was rewritten to define both the normal read path and the manual-re-run read path consistently
  - README.md sync: the Simple row now carries the major-bump exception as a footnote, and the Hard-skip-on-Simple section is retitled "overridable on explicit request" with invocation example
  - Out of scope (deferred): a lightweight coverage-check sub-step that warns when a changed file is not covered by any `check_command`. Out of scope for this release — the `--init` improvement closes the most common TypeScript instance, and a generic coverage-check step needs more design

### extract-rules v1.12.0

- docs(extract-rules): Operational note for post-major-version updates (retrospective-2026-04-20 finding F3)
  - Update Mode now opens with an operational note: after a dependency's major-version bump, run `--update` so the staleness check (Step U3) can flag removed symbols. The note also makes explicit that the current Step U3 check only inspects inline `` `symbol` `` patterns in `## Project-specific patterns` sections (`.local.md`) — code samples inside `.examples.md` are **not** auto-scanned. Manual review of `.examples.md` is required after a major bump; otherwise stale configuration samples there can silently propagate into future plans via reviewers treating project examples as authoritative
  - `--restructure` is not recommended for post-major-bump sync (it does not run a staleness check)
  - Out of scope: Restructure / Conversation / PR-Review mode ripple of the staleness check, fenced-code-block parser for `.examples.md`. Not addressed in this release

Note: `apply-rules` and `merge-rules` are **not** bumped. The `extract-rules` output format is unchanged by this release, and neither SKILL.md references dev-workflow / extract-rules content directly, so their behavior is unaffected.

## 2026-04-18

### dev-workflow v1.29.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.29.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add Step 9.5 Self-Retrospective (Phase 1 — bundle-skill improvement signal)
  - New optional config key `self_retrospective.feedback` (string). When set, a new Step 9.5 runs between Step 9 (Update Rules) and Step 10 (Completion Hooks), scanning the current conversation for improvement signals about the bundled skills (`dev-workflow`, `ask-peer`, `extract-rules`, `rules-review`), sanitizing them, and submitting to a user-configured destination
  - Destination is auto-detected from the `feedback` string: `owner/repo` pattern → GitHub issue via `gh issue create`; paths starting with `/`, `~/`, `./`, `../` → a markdown file under that directory; any other value → warn and skip
  - Raw conversation (jsonl) stays in-session — only abstracted, project-agnostic text leaves. Explicit sanitization rules cover absolute paths, project/repo/product/user names, project-specific code identifiers, and dates/IDs/URLs. User preview + approve/edit/skip loop is always shown before submission
  - Skipped entirely when `self_retrospective.feedback` is unset or invalid (Step 9.5 not registered in TodoWrite). Also hard-skipped when Step 2 assesses the task as Simple difficulty (typo fix, config tweak), regardless of config — Simple tasks rarely exercise the bundled skills enough to produce meaningful signal
  - Repo-mode runs an early `gh auth status` check at Step 1 as a warning only, so the user is alerted up front that Step 9.5 will abort later; Step 9.5 re-checks and aborts with an actionable message as a backstop
  - Issue title is fixed as `[auto-retrospective] dev-workflow-bundle: <N> findings (<YYYY-MM-DD>)` so downstream automation can filter reliably; no default label
  - Full procedure (pre-flight, extraction, sanitization, submission, error handling) lives in `references/self-retrospective.md` (mirrors the Step 1.5 → `task-decomposition.md` deep-reference pattern)
  - Phase 2 (local skill-ification candidates from conversation scan, with create/edit/skip approval UX that writes directly under `.claude/skills/`) is intentionally deferred to a follow-up release (planned 1.30.0). Phase 1 ships the retrospective infrastructure; Phase 2 adds the higher-risk file-creation flow with name validation, allowed-tools constraints, and SKILL.md syntax validation

### dev-workflow v1.28.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.28.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Refine Step 1.5 decomposition heuristic toward independently-verifiable units
  - `references/task-decomposition.md` section B step 1 criteria reordered and rewritten. "The task splits into 2+ units where each unit has a distinct verification path" is now the strongest decompose signal, elevated above cross-module / and-list / staged-refactor heuristics
  - When decomposition signals are mixed, the workflow now biases toward proposing decomposition (the yes/adjust/no dialogue is cheap, smaller shippable PRs cut review load). "Feature looks singular" is no longer sufficient grounds on its own
  - Do NOT decompose criteria reframed around single verification path, atomicity-breaking splits, and a new guardrail against over-splitting (subtasks so small that per-PR overhead exceeds the benefit)
  - Rationale log now names the **primary signal** that drove the decision (e.g. `decompose: 2 distinct verification paths — admin CRUD + chat insertion`), so decomposition bias can be audited after the fact
  - Section B step 3.c decomposition-proposal dialogue now lists each subtask with its `verification_hint` (and `depends_on`), so the user can judge the breakdown at a glance before answering yes/adjust/no
  - Clarified decompose vs. veto precedence: atomicity / over-split vetoes and the single-verification-path case override non-primary positive signals (and-list, cross-layer, staged refactor). Only the primary signal — genuinely distinct verification paths — overrides these vetoes. Resolves the ambiguity where a light "X and Y" request could decompose despite PR overhead outweighing benefit
  - Clarified that `verification_hint` shown in the Step 1.5 proposal is advisory context for the split decision, not a user-approved completion contract — consistent with Step 2's existing treatment of `verification_hint` as AI-authored draft within otherwise-approved state files, so Step 2 can still refine hints without violating the yes the user gave in Step 1.5
  - Addresses a failure mode where features with 2 distinct verification units (e.g. admin CRUD + chat insertion) were classified as "feature contained in one module" and shipped as a single oversized PR, requiring post-hoc splitting
  - README.md "Decomposition judgment" section synced with the new criteria

### dev-workflow v1.27.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.27.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add simplicity-first audit to Step 2 / Plan Review / Code Review
  - Step 2 gains a new `Simplicity self-audit` sub-step. Right after drafting the plan, each element must be traceable to an explicit user requirement, a known bug/constraint, or a documented `.claude/rules/` rule; elements without such a trigger must be dropped or annotated with an explicit rationale
  - Inherited spec files under `.claude/plans/*.md` are treated as prior-session drafts, not confirmed requirements. Task-decomposition state files are the exception: user-approved subtask boundaries, order, `depends_on`, and purposes are honored as-is, while AI-authored descriptions within each subtask remain draft
  - Step 3 category (a) Scope & feasibility is reframed to verify the author's self-audit, so the reviewer focuses on elements with weak or missing rationale rather than re-running the same traceability check
  - Step 8 category (c) Simplicity & maintainability now explicitly flags speculative features without an explicit trigger, catching scope creep that slipped past earlier gates
  - Addresses a failure mode where prior-session plan files were treated as confirmed requirements and carried forward unvetted elaboration into implementation

## 2026-04-13

### dev-workflow v1.26.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.26.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add `Incrementality` category to Step 3 Plan Review
  - Reviewer is now asked whether the plan can be split into smaller, independently verifiable units (hotfix vs refactor, behavior change vs structural change)
  - Catches cases where a task-level "single concern" still bundles independent work at the plan level, where Step 1.5 decomposition correctly passed
  - Regression attribution concerns ("which change caused this?") are called out as a strong splittability signal

## 2026-04-11

### dev-workflow v1.25.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.25.1

- fix(dev-workflow): Explicitly instruct autonomous judgment on review findings
  - Step 3 (Plan Review) and Step 8 (Code Review) now explicitly state "autonomously ... do not ask the user for judgment on individual review findings"
  - Addresses issue where the model deferred to the user on every review finding instead of autonomously applying fixes or rejecting inapplicable points
  - Final fallback to user (Step 3.4 / Step 8.4 for unresolved points after all iterations) remains unchanged

## 2026-04-10

### dev-workflow v1.25.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.25.0

- refactor(dev-workflow): Remove completion hooks prompt from `--init`
  - `--init` no longer asks about hooks — hooks are left unconfigured by default
  - Users can still configure `hooks.on_complete` manually in settings files (execution mode Step 10 unchanged)

### dev-workflow v1.24.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.24.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add 3-layer configuration with type-aware merge
  - New project shared settings file: `.claude/dev-workflow.md` (git tracked, team-shared)
  - Settings are merged across three layers: user global (`~/.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`) → project shared (`.claude/dev-workflow.md`) → personal override (`.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`)
  - Merge strategy: scalar keys are replaced by higher layer; list keys (`check_commands`) are appended and deduplicated; `hooks` is deep-merged (`on_complete` list is appended). `null`/empty explicitly clears the key
  - `--init` now saves to `.claude/dev-workflow.md` (project shared) instead of `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`
  - Existing `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md` continues to work as the highest-priority personal override layer — no migration needed
  - Personal overrides (`.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`) are created manually with only the keys to override

### dev-workflow v1.23.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.23.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add `task_decomposition` setting to disable auto-decomposition in Normal sub-mode
  - Default `true` — existing behavior unchanged
  - Set to `false` to skip Step 1.5's auto-decomposition check entirely — Normal sub-mode requests (`/dev-workflow <task>`) are treated as single tasks. Step 1.5 is omitted from TodoWrite in this mode
  - `--resume <state-file>` is unaffected — existing state files can still be resumed explicitly
  - Non-boolean values fall back to `true` with a warning
- docs(dev-workflow): Refactor SKILL.md for skill-creator best practices
  - Step 1.5 Task Decomposition detail extracted to `references/task-decomposition.md` — SKILL.md drops from 306 to 254 lines (~17% reduction), and simple single-concern runs no longer load state-file semantics they don't need (progressive disclosure)
  - Step 3 / Step 8 `MUST continue re-review` reframed with the *why* (plan modifications often introduce fresh ripple effects; code fixes routinely introduce new bugs) so the instruction persuades instead of insisting
  - No runtime behavior change — all semantics preserved, just documented differently

## 2026-04-09

### dev-workflow v1.22.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.22.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add task decomposition for splitting large tasks into PR-sized subtasks
  - New **Step 1.5: Task Decomposition** runs between Step 1 (Load Settings) and Step 2 (Create Plan)
  - In Normal sub-mode, the workflow lightweightly judges whether the request should be split and proposes a decomposition to the user for approval. Simple, single-concern tasks pass through unchanged
  - Approved decompositions are persisted to `.claude/plans/dev-workflow.<slug>.md` — one state file per parent task, so multiple parent tasks can proceed in parallel
  - Each subtask runs through the existing Step 2–10 flow as an independent PR-sized unit
  - New `--resume <state-file>` flag picks up the next runnable subtask in a fresh session. Accepts full path, filename, or bare slug
  - On subtask completion, the workflow instructs the user to commit + open a PR before resuming the next subtask. The workflow itself never stages, commits, or pushes
  - Parent-task progress is surfaced as a TodoWrite top-level row (`Parent task: N/TOTAL subtasks done — <slug>`)
  - Edge cases handled: YAML parse errors on state files, `depends_on` cycles, missing `--resume` targets, and leftover `in_progress` subtasks from interrupted sessions
  - Step 1.5 is intentionally separate from Plan Mode (which is still reserved for Step 2) so the decomposition proposal is a plain yes/no dialogue

## 2026-04-07

### dev-workflow v1.21.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.21.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add automatic review iteration adjustment based on task difficulty
  - Assesses task difficulty (Simple/Moderate/Complex) after plan creation in Step 2
  - Reduces review iteration count (N) for simpler tasks — configured value acts as ceiling, not target
  - Simple tasks (typo fix, config tweak): N=1, Moderate (single-module multi-file): N=min(2,N), Complex: keep N
  - Explicit `-i N` / `--iterations N` CLI flag skips difficulty assessment (user override)
  - Excess TodoWrite iteration items (Step 3-x, Step 8-x) marked as completed when N is reduced

### All plugins (patch version bump)

- fix: Isolate plugin source directories to prevent duplicate skill registration
  - Each plugin now has its own `plugins/<name>/` source directory with symlinks to `skills/`
  - Previously all plugins shared `source: "./"`, causing Claude Code to auto-discover all skills for every plugin
  - Workaround for [anthropics/claude-code#13344](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13344)
- docs: Update CLAUDE.md to reflect new plugin structure and skill addition flow

## 2026-04-06

### dev-workflow v1.20.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.20.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add `custom_instructions` configuration for injecting user-defined development instructions
  - Free-form string applied to planning (Step 2), plan review (Step 3), implementation (Step 5), simplify (Step 6), and code review (Step 8)
  - Configured via `dev-workflow.local.md` YAML frontmatter
  - `.claude/rules/` and explicit user requests take precedence over `custom_instructions`

### dev-workflow v1.19.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.19.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add hooks configuration for executing skills/commands at workflow timing points
  - `hooks.on_complete`: runs after Step 9 (Update Rules), before completion report
  - Entry format: `Skill(<name>)` for skill invocation, or shell command string
  - Non-blocking: hook failures are reported as warnings in completion summary
  - Configured via `dev-workflow.local.md` YAML frontmatter
- feat(dev-workflow): Add Step 10 (Completion Hooks) to workflow execution
- feat(dev-workflow --init): Add hooks configuration step to project setup flow

## 2026-04-04

### merge-rules v2.0.0 / apply-rules v2.0.0 / extract-rules v1.11.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.3

**Breaking change**: Promoted patterns are now converted to Principles format and integrated into `## Principles`. The `## Project-specific patterns` section is no longer produced by merge-rules. Existing merge-rules output with `## Project-specific patterns` must be regenerated by re-running merge-rules.

- feat(merge-rules): Promote .local.md patterns to Principles format (`Description (signature)`) instead of separate `## Project-specific patterns` section
- feat(merge-rules): Add deduplication against existing Principles to prevent self-amplification from previously promoted patterns in `.local.md`
- feat(merge-rules): Promoted pattern examples are included under `## Principles Examples` (no more `## Project-specific Examples` in output)
- feat(merge-rules): Design note clarifying promoted Principles are permanent org-level rules
- feat(apply-rules): Clean up promoted patterns from `.local.md` files (cross-format duplicate removal)
- feat(apply-rules): Remove corresponding `## Project-specific Examples` entries for cleaned-up patterns
- feat(apply-rules): Delete `.local.md` files that become empty after cleanup
- remove(apply-rules): Remove promoted→`.local.md` routing (promoted patterns are now regular Principles)
- feat(extract-rules): Add cross-format duplicate check in Update mode (Step U4) and Conversation mode to prevent re-adding patterns already promoted to Principles
- refactor: Simplify skill descriptions for merge-rules, apply-rules, and extract-rules to reduce context overhead

### extract-rules v1.10.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.2 (earlier today)

- feat: Remove default size limits from `extract_session_messages.mjs` — all messages included by default
  - `--max-chars` and `--max-per-message` are now optional (default: no limit)
  - Previously defaulted to 100K chars / 2000 chars per message

## 2026-04-03

### extract-rules v1.10.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.1

- feat: `--from-conversation` mode reads full session history from `.jsonl` files on disk
  - No longer limited to context window — captures all messages including those lost to compaction
  - Session file located via encoded project path under `~/.claude/projects/`
  - Supports `<session-id>` argument to target a specific session (default: latest by mtime)
- feat: Delegate heavy processing to subagent to keep main context clean
  - Main agent handles settings + session file resolution (C1-C2)
  - Subagent handles jsonl parsing, analysis, rule extraction, and file writing (C3-C5)
  - Subagent instructions moved to `references/conversation-mode.md` (progressive disclosure)
- feat: Bundle Node.js script `scripts/extract_session_messages.mjs` for jsonl parsing
  - Filters user/assistant text messages, skips tool_use/thinking blocks
  - Recovers `AskUserQuestion` responses via interactive tool ID whitelist
  - Latest-first processing with configurable size limits (100K chars default)
  - Input validation, malformed JSON line diagnostics
- refactor: Replace `Bash(python3 *)` with `Bash(node *)` in allowed-tools (node is guaranteed by Claude Code)
- fix: Update `references/pr-review-mode.md` Step C4 → C5 reference

### dev-workflow v1.18.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.0

- feat: Improve init-mode run-tests generation for autonomous test execution
  - Add Docker daemon readiness check as prerequisite when docker-compose is detected (daemon → services, two-step)
  - Detect existing run-tests skills lacking Docker daemon check and offer regeneration
  - Support `.yaml` extension variants for docker-compose detection
  - Generalize run-tests template: category-based prerequisites, technology-agnostic allowed-tools
  - Add async service retry rule in Process section (re-check with retries for up to 30 seconds)
  - Align pseudo-execute flow with async retry rule

## 2026-04-02

### rules-review v1.0.0

  - Group rules by category (project, languages, frameworks, integrations, custom)
  - Parallel review via sub-agents per group
  - Standalone usage: `/rules-review --base-commit <sha>`

### dev-workflow v1.17.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.17.0

- feat: Add Step 7.5 (Rules Compliance Review) as dedicated rules enforcement step
  - Runs `Skill(rules-review)` between Check/Test (Step 7) and Code Review (Step 8)
  - 2-cycle max: fix violations → re-verify → escalate to user if unresolved
  - Step 8 re-run after code modifications includes Step 7.5
  - Step 8 retains lightweight rules check as safety net
- feat: Bundle `rules-review` skill with `dev-workflow-bundle` plugin

## 2026-04-01

### dev-workflow v1.16.0

- feat: Strengthen rules compliance checking and test coverage verification
  - Step 2: Require specific test files (existing to update or new to create) in test plan, not just abstract descriptions
  - Step 3: Plan reviewer verifies specific test files are identified and existing related tests are covered for update; read all files under `.claude/rules/`
  - Step 8: Reviewer must read all files under `.claude/rules/` and verify compliance against the diff, citing rule file path and violated rule text
  - Step 8: Verify planned test files from Step 2 are present in the diff

### dev-workflow v1.15.1

- fix: Ensure re-review after modifications in Plan Review (Step 3) and Code Review (Step 8)
  - If plan/code was modified based on review feedback, MUST continue to next iteration for re-review
  - If all points were rejected (no modifications), remaining iterations can be skipped
  - Step 8: Consolidate "Re-run Step 7" and "re-review required" under single "code was modified" branch

### dev-workflow v1.15.0

- fix: Strengthen plan approval flow to prevent premature user approval before plan review
  - Step 2: Explicitly forbid presenting plan or asking for approval/confirmation (bold + caps emphasis)
  - Step 3: Add internal review declaration — do not present plan to user during review iterations
  - Step 4: Add `(USER APPROVAL GATE)` to heading, mark as first time user sees the plan
  - Step 4: Add re-review condition — return to Step 3 with new iteration item if user requests material scope/approach changes
  - Step 4: Require explicit user acceptance before proceeding

### apply-rules v1.1.0

- feat: Add `AskUserQuestion` to `allowed-tools` for explicit user confirmation at decision points
  - Step 4 (Integration proposals): batched list with `all / none / number` selection
  - Step 5.5 (File name normalization): confirm renames before applying
  - Step 6 (Principle conflicts): collect all conflicts, present together with `1a, 2c` format
  - Step 7 (Non-conforming files): migration plan as single list, `project.*` excluded from "all"
- feat: Update Conflict Handling table to reflect all `AskUserQuestion` usage points

## 2026-03-31

### apply-rules v1.0.0

- feat: New skill to apply organization-wide rules (merge-rules output) to any project
  - Source specification via GitHub URL or local path (direct path to rules directory)
  - Auto-detect project tech stack (languages, frameworks, integrations) to filter relevant rules
  - Intelligent merge: `.md` (Principles) merged, `.local.md` preserved, promoted patterns routed to `.local.md`
  - Integration proposal: suggest unused but related integration rules for user approval
  - Structure conformance check: migrate non-conforming rule files with user confirmation
  - Fetch from GitHub via `gh api` (no git clone authentication issues)
  - Dry-run mode for previewing changes

## 2026-03-30

### dev-workflow v1.14.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.14.0

- fix: Embed check_commands/test_commands values in TodoWrite Step 7 description to prevent context loss
  - Step 7 registered as `Step 7: Check / Test [check: {check_commands} | test: {test_commands}]`
  - Settings values stay visible through TodoWrite progress checks, reducing risk of AI forgetting commands mid-workflow

### dev-workflow v1.13.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.13.0

- feat: Add test prerequisites check & setup to `run-tests` skill template
  - Auto-detect prerequisites from project files (docker-compose.yml, database.yml, .env.example, bin/setup)
  - Prerequisites section added to generated `run-tests` only when detected
  - Check prerequisites → setup if needed → spawn subagent for test execution; setup failure reports EXECUTION_ERROR with remediation
  - `allowed-tools` in generated skill dynamically includes prerequisite commands
- fix: Use pseudo-execution for `--init` verification step (resolves unregistered skill issue in same session)
  - Read generated SKILL.md and execute test commands directly instead of calling `Skill(run-tests)`
  - Prerequisites checks also run during pseudo-execution
- docs: Add session note — skills generated by `--init` are recognized from the next session onward

### dev-workflow v1.12.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.12.0

- feat: Subagent-based test execution to reduce main context consumption
  - `--init` generates canonical `run-tests` skill with Agent-based subagent execution
  - All test execution goes through `Skill(run-tests)` — no more direct shell commands or arbitrary skill names
  - Subagent returns structured summary (SUCCESS / TEST_FAILED / EXECUTION_ERROR) instead of raw test output
  - Includes stack trace excerpts and code locations for failures — enough to fix without re-running
  - Scope decision delegated to `run-tests` skill via `--base-commit <sha>` argument
  - Existing `run-tests` in current format is reused; outdated format is automatically regenerated (test commands are preserved)
- docs: Add `run-tests` SKILL.md template to `references/init-mode.md`

### dev-workflow v1.11.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.11.0

- feat: Add `review_iterations` default value (3) to `--init` generated config file
- feat: Add verification step after `--init` config creation
  - Run check_commands and test_commands to verify they work
  - `Skill()` entries: select a test file and invoke the skill, or run minimum test scope
  - Report pass/fail summary; failures suggest fixes but do not block

## 2026-03-28

### dev-workflow v1.10.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.10.0

- feat: Enhance `--init` test_commands detection with test skill auto-detection and generation
  - Detect existing test skills in `.claude/skills/` (e.g., `test-file`, `run-tests`) and propose `Skill(<name>)`
  - Auto-generate `run-tests` skill when 3+ distinct test scopes detected (with overwrite protection)
  - Fall back to direct commands for 1-2 test scopes, or project-type standard commands
- refactor: Extract Init Mode instructions to `references/init-mode.md` for progressive disclosure

### dev-workflow v1.9.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.9.0
