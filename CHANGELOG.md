### extract-rules v1.20.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.56.1

- fix(extract-rules): retarget the § Sub-skill caller directive's locator for dev-workflow's Pre-invocation reminder
  - Category: ambiguity; the dev-workflow v1.54.1 extraction moved the `**Pre-invocation reminder**` paragraph from SKILL.md § Step 11 into `references/update-rules.md` § Char-count compaction gate, leaving the cross-skill locator pointing at the old direct location (still resolvable in 2 hops via the retained sub-step skeleton, but no longer literal). Updated the locator to name the reference file.

### dev-workflow v1.54.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.56.1

- refactor(dev-workflow): extract Step 10 / Step 11 procedure bodies into on-demand references (no behavior change)
  - Moves the Step 10 (Interactive Commits) procedure body (Procedures 1–9 plus the deferred-bookkeeping pass) to the new `references/interactive-commits.md`, and the Step 11 sub-step 3 (Char-count compaction gate) procedure body to the new `references/update-rules.md`, both verbatim. SKILL.md keeps the runtime-referenced definitions inline: section headings, entry / skip conditions, the `landed_count` / `compaction_applied_count` / `below_threshold_failed_files` cross-step contracts, the § Approval token closed list, and the § Localized summary tokens. Resident SKILL.md size drops from 164,911 to 144,481 chars (−20,430); the two new reference files (23,766 chars total) load on demand only when Step 10 / Step 11 execute. Same extraction + stable-anchor pattern as v1.48.5 (handoff measure M3; the realized reduction is below the handoff's 24–26k estimate because Step 11 sub-steps 1 / 2 stay inline per the agreed criterion).

## 2026-06-08

### peer v2.3.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.56.0

- feat(ask-peer): make peer consultation host-aware for Claude Code and Codex
  - Replaces the Claude-subagent-only framing with a host-aware dispatch contract: use Claude Code `Agent` when available, use Codex subagent / delegation surfaces when exposed, and retain the existing inline fallback when reviewer dispatch is unavailable or nested dispatch cannot recurse. The peer personality, review rubric, parallel category merge behavior, and failure-surfacing policy are unchanged.

### rules-review v1.2.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.56.0

- feat(rules-review): support host-aware reviewer dispatch while preserving output compatibility
  - Generalizes the Review phase from Claude `Agent`-only dispatch to the current host's reviewer-dispatch mechanism, covering Claude Code `Agent`, Codex subagent / delegation surfaces, and the existing inline sequential fallback. The Markdown report format and exact `No rule violations found` compliant verdict remain unchanged for existing callers.

### tidy v1.2.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.56.0

- feat(tidy): make cleanup reviewer dispatch and progress tracking host-aware
  - Reframes the iteration loop around a host-provided reviewer instead of a Claude-only subagent, while keeping main-thread `Edit` application and the fenced JSON return contract unchanged. The task-tracking prose now allows Claude Code Task tools, compatible Codex task tracking, `TodoWrite`, or in-memory iteration state when no progress tools are surfaced.

### dev-workflow v1.54.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.55.0

- feat(dev-workflow): wire timestamp/usage measurement into the Step 11.5 self-retrospective subagent
  - Extends `references/self-retrospective.md` §2.1 step 2 to extract `timestamp` and `message.usage` from session jsonl entries (entries missing these fields are skipped for interval computation). Adds §2.1 step 2a interval computation: wall-clock intervals between consecutive assistant entries, user-gate idle exclusion (assistant→user gap), and cumulative `output_tokens` per phase. Minimum data requirement: fewer than 2 valid-timestamp assistant entries skips interval computation gracefully. Measured evidence (approximate seconds, token counts) is embedded in Finding `description` prose — the return schema is unchanged, so the downstream `dev-workflow-triage` consumer needs no coordinated change. Updates §2.2 signal definitions for Token-consumption inefficiency and Development-speed friction to reference measured data. Adds §3 sanitization rule: absolute timestamps → relative intervals only (session timing not leaked). The `Category` enum is deliberately **not** extended (prior Decision from v1.51.0).

### dev-workflow v1.53.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.54.0

- feat(dev-workflow): optimize the plan format for review load and in-progress followability
  - Redefined the must-review tier in `references/plan-format.md` § Review guide line from `Highlights + Decisions` to `Overview + Decisions` (Highlights is one Overview bullet, so Overview subsumes it). This fixes a pre-existing inconsistency with § Step 4 presentation order, which already renders Overview-in-full + Decisions-in-full, and gives empty-`Decisions` plans a substantive review anchor (Goal / Approach). Removed the now-stale "When Highlights is omitted, name Decisions alone" special-case; synced the localized ja/en samples, the Template block, the Sizing-guidance wording, and README's "Two-tier presentation" line.
  - § Template now lets Design be an ordered, numbered list of implementation steps when the work is sequential (preferred-when-sequential; by-file otherwise), so the implementer can follow it top-to-bottom. SKILL.md Step 5 may register each Design step as an implementation sub-task (permissive `MAY`, consistent with Step 1's "additions, not replacements" rule); Step 2 gains a one-line pointer.
  - Added a lightweight, one-directional traceability convention (new § Traceability, single source of truth): Test → Design step (recommended), Design → Decision (optional), and the must-review tier carries no back-references. Added a must-review low-load rule paragraph, three § Step 2 self-check items, and a § Step 3 (f) traceability-resolution clause.

## 2026-06-07

### extract-rules v1.20.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.53.0

- fix(extract-rules): add ordering/sequencing self-check to Step C4 classification (auto-triage #77)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step C4 lacked a classifier for ordering/sequencing rules derived from incidental session execution order, causing the skill to stage directional rules without checking whether the observed order was intentional. Added item 5 with a self-check, guidance to prefer underlying invariants over directional rules, and an annotation convention (`[NEEDS DIRECTION CONFIRMATION]` prefix) for unconfirmed directional patterns.

### dev-workflow v1.52.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.52.0

- fix(dev-workflow): add plan-scope cross-reference to Step 10 commit-plan proposal (auto-triage #78)
  - Category: missing-branch; the commit-plan proposal lacked a cross-reference against declared no-change areas in the approved plan. Added a plan-scope cross-reference that surfaces any collected change overlapping a declared no-change area as "unplanned changes" above the numbered commit list, routed through the existing commit-plan approval gate.
- fix(dev-workflow): extend Resume subtask selection to check per-subtask precondition prose (auto-triage #77)
  - Category: missing-branch; Resume sub-mode treated `depends_on` completion as the only runnability gate, ignoring per-subtask precondition/readiness-gate prose. Extended the no-leftover branch to check each frontier candidate's description for explicit gating prose and ask the user to choose when machine-unverifiable gates exist.

### dev-workflow v1.51.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.51.0

- feat(dev-workflow): add token-consumption and development-speed perspectives to the Step 11.5 self-retrospective
  - Extends `references/self-retrospective.md` §2.2 with two new signal types — **Token-consumption inefficiency** (wasteful token spend: cross-turn re-reads, re-derivation of in-context values, unnecessary subagent dispatch, redundant prose) and **Development-speed friction** (disproportionate wall-clock time / round-trips, carrying a "never by dropping review or verification coverage" quality guardrail). §2.3 gains an imperative categorization rule that routes efficiency-class findings to the existing enum values (`wrong-default` when the inefficiency stems from a default-behavior choice, otherwise `other`). The `Category` enum is deliberately **not** extended, so the downstream `dev-workflow-triage` consumer (its 5-value `Category` validator and comment template) needs no coordinated change.

### dev-workflow v1.50.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.50.2

- fix(dev-workflow): give Step 7 background-dispatch availability detection a positive criterion (default to parallel)
  - Category: missing-branch; the Step 7 "Availability detection" bullet stated only a negative constraint ("do not let detection collapse to the base `Agent` tool exists") without a positive, checkable criterion for confirming `run_in_background` support, so an orchestrator in a parallel-capable main-thread session could resolve the uncertainty to "unavailable" and silently serialize the Step 7.5 rules-review and Step 8 first-pass code-review background launches. Rewrote the canonical "Availability detection" bullet to add a positive criterion (background dispatch is **available** when `Agent` is exposed AND a `run_in_background` / async-dispatch capability is present → the common interactive-session case, so default to parallel) plus a two-item closed list defining "unavailable" (`Agent` absent — which also covers the non-recursing-subagent case — or `Agent` present but no background/detached dispatch capability, e.g. an older Claude Code), and converted the two "If unavailable" parentheticals to back-references so the closed list is the single definition of "unavailable". Backward-compatible — genuinely background-dispatch-incapable environments still take the sequential path.

## 2026-06-06

### dev-workflow v1.50.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.50.1

- fix(dev-workflow): add target-file constraint/invariant audit to simplicity-self-audit (auto-triage #76)
  - Category: missing-branch; the Step 2 Simplicity self-audit had no prompt to read the explicit constraints and invariants declared in target files before finalizing the implementation approach. Added a "Target-file constraint-and-invariant audit" checklist item with an unconditional per-file scan trigger.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Markdown block-element structural integrity audit to Step 5 (auto-triage #76)
  - Category: missing-branch; the Step 5 late-stage scaffolding self-audit had no check for adjacent block elements in Markdown files missing blank-line separators. Added sub-check (v) to scan all edited .md files and fix inline before proceeding.
- fix(dev-workflow): add alias/derived-form sweep to Step 5 full-repo grep (auto-triage #75)
  - Category: missing-branch; the Step 5 full-repo grep used a two-stage structure (exact + fuzzy) with no stage for alias and derived-form variants, so rename/migration tasks could miss same-concept usages under alternate spellings. Extended to a multi-stage structure with a new stage (iii) for alias/derived-form sweep.

### dev-workflow v1.50.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.50.0

- feat(dev-workflow): parallelize the Step 8 first-pass code review via a background `Agent` (first pass only)
  - **Backward compatible** — when background `Agent` dispatch is unavailable, when N=0 (Trivial), or on any re-run, Step 8 dispatches the reviewer sequentially exactly as before. Building on v1.49.0's concurrent rules-review launch, Step 7 now also optionally launches the Step 8 first-pass `reviewer` skill (e.g. `Skill(ask-peer)`) as a background subagent (`run_in_background`) so its read-only analysis overlaps the `test_commands` phase. Step 8 sub-step 1 collects that result when it is still fresh and dispatches fresh otherwise. Two tracking variables govern the decision: `first_pass_review_launched` (set on a successful dispatch, gated `run_in_background` available ∧ N≥1 ∧ first pass) and `first_pass_review_stale` (set when an intervening edit changes the analyzed diff before the collect point — a `test_commands` failure fix in Step 7, or any fix Step 7.5 applies; both initialized unconditionally before the availability branch). The discard decision is owned by Step 8 sub-step 1, which reuses the background result only when `first_pass_review_launched` is true and `first_pass_review_stale` is false. Extends the line-81 invariant from "Step 7's concurrent rules-review launch" to "Step 7's two concurrent background launches" (the step count stays two: Step 11.5 + Step 7). Re-runs of Step 8 (sub-step 3) stay sequential. Validated via a Step 0 smoke test confirming the configured reviewer (default `ask-peer`, via its SKILL.md § Process 1 inline fallback) runs in a background general-purpose subagent.

### dev-workflow v1.49.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.49.0

- feat(dev-workflow): parallelize Step 7 tests and Step 7.5 rules-review via a background `Agent` (first pass only)
  - **Backward compatible** — when background `Agent` dispatch is unavailable in the environment, Step 7.5 invokes `Skill(rules-review)` sequentially exactly as before. After `check_commands` pass, Step 7 now optionally launches the first-pass `Skill(rules-review)` as a background subagent (`run_in_background`) so its read-only analysis overlaps the `test_commands` phase; Step 7.5 sub-step 1 collects that result (or invokes directly on re-runs, or after the background result was discarded following a test failure). Only `rules-review` is backgrounded — `run-tests` has no inline fallback for the nested-`Agent`-unavailable case (`rules-review` does, per its SKILL.md § 5). Relaxes the line-81 invariant from "only Step 11.5 directly spawns `Agent`" to the two-step set (Step 11.5 + Step 7's concurrent rules-review launch). Re-runs (Step 7.5 sub-step 3.b, Step 8 sub-step 3) stay sequential. Validated via a Step 0 smoke test of the background-`Agent` mechanism.

### dev-workflow v1.48.7 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.7

- fix(dev-workflow): reformat the Step 4 plan Review guide directive into a multi-line blockquote for readability
  - Category: ambiguity; the `> Review guide` directive at the top of the Step 4 plan crammed the must-review and reference section groups onto one line with a `|` separator, making it hard to tell at a glance which sections need the user's judgment versus which are reference detail. Reformatted it in `references/plan-format.md` (§ Template sample, § Review guide line defining sentence, and the paired bilingual en/ja samples) into a multi-line blockquote — a heading line followed by one bullet per category.

## 2026-06-05

### dev-workflow v1.48.6 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.6

- fix(dev-workflow): extend Step 4 prose-language audit to check concept word density (auto-triage #72)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 4's pre-presentation language self-audit only verified that prose body and headings used the target language, missing the case where many English concept words remained embedded in Japanese prose (when localization specifies a native-language output). Extended the audit to also flag excessive untranslated concept words, distinguishing allowed identifiers (type/function/config-key names, API/flag names) from concept words that must be translated.
- fix(dev-workflow): add candidate-list implementation boundary to Step 4 presentation (auto-triage #72)
  - Category: ambiguity; when Step 4 presents a multi-candidate proposal menu with a recommended first item, the execution model — only the recommended item is implemented this run, the rest are record-only candidates — was not clear from the presentation. Added a Step 4 presentation rule requiring candidate-list plans to state explicitly what is implemented this run, what is record-only, and that sequential execution of multiple items needs separate task decomposition.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Step 7 branch for EXECUTION_ERROR + pre-declared degraded procedure (auto-triage #71)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 7's enumerated pause gates covered only "failure after 3 retries" and "scope violation", with no branch for an execution-environment error (external resource contention) when the plan had pre-declared a degraded procedure. Added a Step 7 branch that auto-applies a plan-agreed degraded path with a one-line note and only falls to a user gate when no degraded path was declared.
- fix(dev-workflow): broaden Step 11 skip guard for transitive wrapper hooks (auto-triage #71)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 11's extract-rules skip guard keyed on a literal name match against hook entries, so a wrapper hook entry that transitively invokes extract-rules would not be recognized and the guard would silently fail to fire. Broadened the guard to detect the conversation scan via output-based evidence (output contains `staged_count` or `promoted_count`) rather than literal name matching.
- fix(dev-workflow): add same-session re-invocation continuation branch to --resume (auto-triage #69)
  - Category: ambiguity; the Resume sub-mode did not state how a `--resume` re-invocation should behave when the named subtask is already `in_progress` and mid-execution in the current session — a literal reading could destructively restart from the planning step. Added a "Same-session re-invocation" branch to route to the current pause point (preserving in-session progress) when in-context evidence of prior progress exists.
- fix(dev-workflow): add peer-dependency compatibility self-audit for major version bumps (auto-triage #66)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 2's author-side Simplicity self-audit had a primary-source check for an updated library's API/config but no check that a major-bumped dependency's declared peer range is compatible with the already-resolved version of a co-existing core dependency — the equivalent compatibility check existed only in the Step 3 reviewer, creating a one-step detection-lag asymmetry. Added a symmetric author-side self-audit bullet.

### dev-workflow v1.48.5 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.5

- refactor(dev-workflow): extract the Step 2 Simplicity self-audit checklist into a dedicated reference to cut SKILL.md resident size
  - Moved the full Step 2 Simplicity self-audit checklist out of `SKILL.md` into a new `references/simplicity-self-audit.md`, replacing the inline block with a one-line delegation pointer that keeps the `Simplicity self-audit` label intact — the stable phrase anchor used by Step 3 reviewer category (a), Step 5 late-stage scaffolding self-audit, `references/plan-format.md`, and `references/task-decomposition.md` still resolves. `SKILL.md` shrinks from ~176k to ~149k chars, lowering the per-turn resident-context cost on every run; the checklist now loads on demand at Step 2. Step 3 reviewer instruction updated to read the new reference. No runtime behavior change.

### dev-workflow v1.48.4 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.4

- feat(dev-workflow): two-tier Step 4 plan presentation + Overview Highlights slot + readability-first sizing guidance
  - Step 4 now presents a condensed plan in chat (the `> Review guide` line + Overview, Decisions, and Design as a file-list) while the full plan body is written to the Plan Mode file that the `ExitPlanMode` approval modal renders — so the review surface stays scannable without losing detail. Added an omittable `Highlights` Overview slot that surfaces high-impact items (DB migrations, destructive operations, breaking changes) at the top of every plan, a `> Review guide` line convention (must-review = Highlights/Decisions, reference = Design/Test plan/Risks) with a localization rule + paired bilingual sample, and rewrote `references/plan-format.md` § Sizing guidance to be readability-first (cut only redundancy/padding, never review-load-bearing detail, with an operational padding test). `SKILL.md` Step 4 sub-step 2 and `README.md` updated to match.

## 2026-06-04

### dev-workflow v1.48.3 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.3

- fix(dev-workflow): add authoritative-tool cross-check sub-clause to Step 5 item 5 (auto-triage #65)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 5's implementation self-check had no clause directing the agent to back up load-bearing enumeration claims with the authoritative tool that consumes the result (e.g. type checker, language server) rather than treating hand-written search results alone as definitive. New sub-clause added to Step 5 item 5.
- fix(dev-workflow): add externally-blocked primary objective tracking to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #64)
  - Category: wrong-default; when a subtask's primary objective is blocked by an external dependency, the plan's default was to record the deferral in prose only rather than promoting it to a tracked, first-class follow-up subtask. New bullet in Step 2 Simplicity self-audit directs the agent to treat externally-blocked primary objectives as first-class tracked deferrals.
- fix(dev-workflow): add skip guard for already-run extract-rules conversation extraction in Step 11 (auto-triage #64)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 11's conversation-based rule-extraction sub-step had no check for whether the same extraction had already run via the on_complete hook earlier in the session — double-extraction could advance the staged-promotion counter by two observations for a single session. New guard directs the agent to skip Step 11 extraction when the hook already ran it this session.
- fix(dev-workflow): add execution-time deferral/exclusion gate to Completion subtask flow (auto-triage #63)
  - Category: missing-branch; the subtask Completion flow had no mandatory gate checking whether in-scope work items were excluded, deferred, or discovered as unassigned during implementation/testing — items recorded only in prose were invisible to --resume and would be permanently skipped. New "Execution-time deferral/exclusion gate" paragraph added before the numbered subtask-completion steps.
- fix(dev-workflow): add cleanup step for per-agent staging documents in Completion section (auto-triage #62)
  - Category: missing-branch; Completion had no branch to delete per-agent staging files generated by dispatched review subagents during the run — these accumulated as untracked noise in the working tree. New "Derived staging artifact cleanup" paragraph added at the top of the Completion section, using `rm -f .claude/plans/<slug>-agent-*.md`.

## 2026-06-03

### dev-workflow v1.48.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.2

- fix(dev-workflow): add generated-artifact regeneration check for major upgrades (auto-triage #61)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 Focus area (a) had no check for generated artifacts (lock files, config snapshots, derived fixed files) whose non-regeneration rationale rests solely on format compatibility — new major versions may embed additional metadata into those artifacts even when the format-version integer is unchanged, making format compatibility and regeneration necessity orthogonal concerns. New bullet directs plan reviewers to verify both axes independently and to require an empirical validation step when the non-regeneration rationale rests solely on format compatibility.

### ask-peer v2.2.10 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.2

- fix(ask-peer): add verification-safety principle to peer agent personality (auto-triage #61)
  - Category: missing-branch; Core Principles had no guidance for when a peer reviewer suggests or performs verification steps requiring state changes (VCS checkouts, package installs, build artifacts) — uncommitted working-tree changes could be silently destroyed mid-verification. New Verification safety bullet directs the peer to prefer non-destructive read-only verification by default, and when state-mutating steps are unavoidable to snapshot affected state (e.g. `git stash -u` for VCS working trees), perform the verification, then restore.

## 2026-06-02

### dev-workflow v1.48.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.1

- fix(dev-workflow): add commit-split boundary alignment check to Step 2 self-audit (auto-triage #60)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 2 self-audit had no check confirming that a proposed commit-split boundary aligns with the file-level granularity of the staging mechanism — splits planned across changes within the same file could not be realized at staging time. New bullet directs plan authors to confirm commit boundaries fall on file boundaries before finalizing split proposals.
- fix(dev-workflow): add blast-radius classification primary-source verification to Step 2 self-audit (auto-triage #59)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 2 had no audit item requiring primary-source confirmation before using scope classifications (distributed vs. internal-only) as Decisions rationale — an unverified claim led to an incorrect plan boundary that required user correction at the Step 4 gate. New bullet directs plan authors to verify distribution-status and blast-radius classifications against actual registration or placement before citing them.
- fix(dev-workflow): add deferred-work tracking vocabulary to Step 2 self-audit (auto-triage #59)
  - Category: ambiguity; when presenting deferred scope as an option, the term "delegate to a separate task" conflated "tracked subtask split" (state preserved, resumable) and "untracked separation" (memo-only, no follow-up obligation), causing the user to ask for clarification. New bullet requires the plan to distinguish these two paths and state their tracking implications when deferring scope.
- fix(dev-workflow): add deferred-work surfacing in fixed location to Step 2 self-audit (auto-triage #59)
  - Category: missing-branch; deferred scope decisions were buried in rationale prose with no fixed, user-reachable location capturing what was deferred, why, and the intended follow-up flow — two successive clarification requests from the user were needed to locate the decision. New bullet requires deferral records to appear at a dedicated, reachable anchor (follow-up notes, Risks/Context section, or equivalent).
- fix(dev-workflow): add pathspec to Step 10 d. Commit templates to prevent hook scope expansion (auto-triage #58)
  - Category: wrong-default; the Commit sub-step command templates (`git commit -m` / `git commit -F - <<EOF`) lacked `-- "<path-1>" "<path-2>" ...` pathspec, so any auto-staging hook running between Stage and Commit could widen the commit beyond the staged scope, requiring a reset and re-commit. Templates now include the pathspec-scoped form and a one-line note explaining that this is a defense against inter-step re-staging.
- fix(dev-workflow): add plan-deferred edits application point before Step 10 Procedure 1 (auto-triage #57)
  - Category: ambiguity; neither Step 5 nor Step 10 specified where to apply edits the plan explicitly deferred to commit time (e.g. CHANGELOG entries, version-bump lines) — the executing agent had to infer the application timing ad-hoc. New paragraph at Step 10 entry directs the agent to apply plan-deferred bookkeeping edits before Procedure 1 collects the working tree, with no user gate, so they are captured in the commit grouping.

### dev-workflow v1.48.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.48.0

- feat(dev-workflow): **Behavior change — Step 11.5 (Self-Retrospective) now runs regardless of task difficulty** — Step 11.5 fires on every run where `self_retrospective.feedback` is configured, including Simple/Trivial tasks that previously hard-skipped it. The Step 2 difficulty assessment now gates only the review-iteration count N (Step 3 / Step 8); it no longer gates the self-retrospective. Resolves dev-workflow-issues #55 (remove the Simple/Trivial hard-skip rather than add an opt-out flag) and #56 (separate the two concerns the difficulty assessment was gating). Removed the now-dead "Manual re-run (same-session only)" path — its only trigger, recovery from an auto-skip, no longer exists — while preserving the multi-instance jsonl-mismatch safeguard in `references/self-retrospective.md` §1.4. Swept all 11 difficulty-gating sites across SKILL.md / README.md / `references/self-retrospective.md` (canonical + dev-workflow-bundle copy). **For existing users**: a project with `self_retrospective.feedback` set will now see the Step 11.5 preview + approval gate at the end of Simple/Trivial runs.

## 2026-06-01

### ask-peer v2.2.9 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.47.1

- fix(ask-peer): add session-loaded primary-source verification clause to Planning Focus (auto-triage #54)
  - Category: other; Reviewer's Planning audit list had no clause directing the reviewer to consult session-available primary sources (loaded tool schemas, the run's own successful invocations, file declarations the reviewer can read) before reporting absence as a hypothesis to challenge — false-positive findings cost an orchestrator round-trip to re-cite the same source already in scope. New clause inserted before `internal reference-doc sample-code verification` with explicit boundary disambiguation; principle abstract + skill-development examples in parentheses per distribution rule.
- refactor(ask-peer): split Planning / Code Review-Focus run-on bullets into nested lists (behavior unchanged, clause wording verbatim)
  - Readability / diff-reviewability: the Planning Review-Focus bullet was a single semicolon-joined run-on of ~15 named audit clauses (and the Code bullet appended one more); split each clause into its own nested bullet so diffs no longer collapse to a one-line replacement and clause coverage is scannable. Verified verbatim-preserving (rejoining the nested bullets with `; ` reproduces the prior lines byte-for-byte); the canonical and dev-workflow-bundle copies were updated in sync.
- fix(ask-peer): add dispatch-unavailable inline fallback to Process + single-shot review degenerate-case handling (CHANGELOG backfill for the commit "enhance process description for subagent dispatch and feedback handling")
  - Category: missing-branch; Process step 1 assumed subagent dispatch is always available — added a fallback directing the main thread to adopt the Peer Agent Personality inline when the `Agent` tool is absent or nested dispatch is blocked.
  - Category: ambiguity; the "confirm Issue / Goal / Constraints first" checklist read as a blocking gate with no single-shot guidance — added a bullet directing the reviewer to state working assumptions inline and proceed when no round-trip channel exists.

### dev-workflow v1.47.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.47.1

- fix(dev-workflow): add platform-capability-dependent default change audit to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #53)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 2 Simplicity self-audit had no audit item for default-behavior changes that depend on a specific execution-environment capability not uniformly available across the target deployment / runtime environment set, so environment-specific absence surfaced only at Step 10 commit-approval and forced a full rewind. New bullet directs plan authors to enumerate target environments and confirm uniform availability before adopting an exclusive switch as Recommendation, and to surface a conditional-fallback design as a co-equal Decisions Alternative when uniform availability cannot be confirmed.

### dev-workflow v1.47.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.47.0

- feat(dev-workflow): **Prefer the Task tools (`TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList`) for session task tracking, with `TodoWrite` as the fallback** — Claude Code v2.1.142 made the Task tools the default (disabling `TodoWrite` by default), so the workflow now registers phases via one `TaskCreate` per phase (issued in a single upfront burst to preserve the "register all phases upfront / don't drop steps" guarantee), marks status via `TaskUpdate`, and reads task status at GATE / phase-boundary self-audit checkpoints via `TaskList` (resolving by subject, since `taskId` is auto-numbered). Where the Task tools are unavailable (e.g. the VSCode extension, or Claude Code before v2.1.142), the workflow uses the equivalent `TodoWrite` operations instead — a new "Tool availability" note in Step 1 documents the equivalence and `allowed-tools` retains `TodoWrite` alongside the Task tools, so behavior is preserved across environments (no breakage). The status enum (`pending` / `in_progress` / `completed`) is unchanged. The `Parent-task TodoWrite row` (references/task-decomposition.md) is renamed `Parent-task progress row`, and its single-`in_progress` rationale is rewritten as an operational convention rather than asserting the Task tools hard-enforce a single `in_progress` (that enforcement is unverified from primary source).

### extract-rules v1.19.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.47.0

- feat(extract-rules): **Prefer the Task tools for `--compact` per-file progress tracking, with `TodoWrite` as the fallback** — Step CP2's per-file pre-register pass now uses `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` (status enum unchanged; per-file outcome continues to be carried in the per-file record, not the task status), and falls back to the equivalent `TodoWrite` operations where the Task tools are unavailable (e.g. the VSCode extension). `allowed-tools` gains `TaskCreate, TaskUpdate` and retains `TodoWrite`. Tracks the Claude Code v2.1.142 default task-tool change; no change to compaction logic.

### tidy v1.1.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.47.0

- feat(tidy): **Prefer the Task tools for iteration progress tracking, with `TodoWrite` as the fallback** — Step 3's iteration pre-register pass now uses `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` (status enum unchanged; the early-convergence skip note moves to the task `description` field). The fallback paragraph (renamed `Task tools unavailable fallback`) now covers both cases: use `TodoWrite` where the Task tools are unavailable but `TodoWrite` is present (e.g. the VSCode extension), and hold iteration state in main-thread context only where neither is surfaced (the nested-subagent case). `allowed-tools` gains `TaskCreate, TaskUpdate` and retains `TodoWrite`. Tracks the Claude Code v2.1.142 default task-tool change.

### dev-workflow v1.46.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.46.0

- feat(dev-workflow): **Step 6 (Tidy) now prefers the built-in `simplify` skill** — Step 6 invokes `Skill(simplify)` first and falls back to the bundled in-house `Skill(tidy)` (after a one-line fallback note) only on Claude Code versions that lack the built-in `simplify`. The Step 6 phase name "Tidy" and related labels (Tidy-revival check, etc.) are intentionally kept — only the invoked callee and the callee-enumeration cross-references (frontmatter `allowed-tools`, § No-Stall Principle, § Progress Visibility, § Step 11.5 Agent-usage, § Step 7.5) gain the `simplify` / `tidy` pairing. **Behavior change**: on Claude Code with built-in `simplify`, the Step 6 cleanup pass is now performed by `simplify` rather than `tidy`. Note: `simplify` is a built-in with no on-disk SKILL.md, so its argument interface is unverified — the `simplify` path passes no scope argument and only an optional best-effort `custom_instructions` hint; should a future upstream re-scope `simplify`, Step 6 behavior could shift silently (revisit on the next Claude Code update).

### dev-workflow v1.45.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.45.0

- feat(dev-workflow): **Add `Trivial` difficulty tier** (below Simple) to Step 2's difficulty assessment — Trivial tasks (typo, one-line edit, config value change with a single unambiguous solution) now skip Step 3 (Plan Review) and Step 8 (Code Review) entirely (`N = 0`). Simple stays at `N = 1`, Moderate at `N = min(2, N)`, Complex unchanged — the new tier is purely additive, so Simple/Moderate/Complex tasks behave exactly as before. Trivial classification is gated conservatively: only a genuinely self-evident change qualifies, and any doubt (multi-part edit, non-unique fix, approach uncertainty) falls to Simple or above so internal review is retained. Even for Trivial tasks the Step 4 plan-approval gate, Step 7 / 7.5 checks, and `hooks.on_complete` still run, so review is reduced — not eliminated. Step 3 / Step 8 entry points, the Step 7.5→8 GATE, the Step 4 completed-row verification, and the "reviewed in Step 3" prose (SKILL.md / `references/plan-format.md` / README) are all made `N=0`-aware; Step 11.5 (Self-Retrospective) hard-skip and the plan `Difficulty` enum are extended from Simple to Simple/Trivial. Opt out per invocation by passing `-i N` (explicit iteration counts bypass difficulty auto-adjustment as before).

### dev-workflow v1.44.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.44.0

- chore(release): synchronize dev-workflow and dev-workflow-bundle plugin versions to v1.44.0 (dev-workflow +39 patch jump from v1.40.1, dev-workflow-bundle unchanged — resolve accumulated version skew)

## 2026-05-24

### extract-rules v1.18.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.44.0

- feat(extract-rules): **Default change — `compaction_threshold: 40000`** — set `compaction_threshold: 32000` in `.claude/extract-rules.local.md` or `~/.claude/extract-rules.local.md` to opt out and restore the prior 80% buffer. The new default matches Claude Code's per-file warning threshold (40k chars, observed in Claude Code 2.1.x) exactly — `--compact` now fires the gate at the same point the user sees the warning, rather than 8k chars earlier. **Behavior change — `consolidation_proposals` auto-apply** — to restore v1.17.0 detection-only behavior (the only available opt-out path, coarse-grained), set `min_cluster_size: 99999999` in `.claude/extract-rules.local.md` to disable consolidation detection entirely. There is intentionally **no fine-grained flag** for "keep detection, skip auto-apply" — Step CP2 (c2)'s main-thread synthesis is wired directly into the apply phase, and the caller (e.g. `dev-workflow` Step 11 with `compact_rules: true`) provides the user-gate layer for per-file accept/reject. Also changes the `--compact` mode's apply behavior: `consolidation_proposals` are now **auto-applied via main-thread synthesis** (new Step CP2 (c2) phase) — the main thread reads each cluster's `cluster_bullets[].snippet` as a byte-level prefix seed, extracts the verbatim full bullet, and synthesizes the corresponding `Edit` calls (insertion of `merged_principle.text` above `cluster_bullets[0]` + per-replacement `delete` / `cross_ref` edits, with `cross_ref` preferred on ambiguous emission). The subagent contract (analysis-only, `Forbidden tool calls`, `merged_principle.text` is detection output only) is **preserved** — the auto-apply layer lives entirely in the main thread, so the subagent never emits `Edit` calls. `applied_edits_count` is now the sum of compaction-mechanical edits + consolidation-synthesized edits, and the `(d) Per-iter convergence check` uses this widened counter uniformly. **Behavior change from v1.17.0**: v1.17.0 established `consolidation_proposals` as detection-only with no auto-apply (sibling to `structural_notes` as caller-judgment output). This release adds the main-thread auto-apply layer, so a caller invoking `--compact` directly (without an outer user-gate like `dev-workflow` Step 11) no longer sees the consolidation cluster as a "proposal to act on" — the file is mutated in-place. The `dev-workflow` Step 11 compaction approval gate (`compact_rules: true`) still surfaces the per-file diff and accepts/rejects atomically; `structural_notes` remain caller-judgment as before. New `Compact cross_ref wording guidance` subsection in `references/compaction-mode.md` documents the soft wording targets (≤150 chars per `cross_ref_text`, ≤400 chars per `merged_principle.text`) the subagent should aim for, with anchors and explicit non-enforcement labeling. **Downstream automation note**: automated runs that invoke `extract-rules --compact` from CI / scheduled jobs and do not pin `compaction_threshold` explicitly will see the threshold raised from 32000 to 40000 on first run after upgrading — files in the 32001–39999 range that previously triggered will no longer trigger. Pin `compaction_threshold` explicitly in `.claude/extract-rules.local.md` if a stable threshold is required. The auto-apply default cannot be pinned to v1.17.0 detection-only behavior without disabling consolidation entirely via `min_cluster_size` (see above).

### extract-rules v1.17.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.43.0

- feat(extract-rules): extend `--compact` mode with consolidation detection — the dispatched subagent now additionally identifies clusters of ≥`min_cluster_size` related bullets (default 3) per the new consolidation heuristics in `references/compaction-mode.md` § Consolidation heuristics, and emits cluster proposals (`cluster_bullets` + `merged_principle` + `replacements` with `delete` / `cross_ref` strategy) in the new `consolidation_proposals[]` field of each per-file record. Detection-only — proposals are not auto-applied (sibling to existing `structural_notes` as caller-judgment output). Top-level `status: "compacted"` mapping extended to a 3-way OR (`applied_edits_count > 0` OR non-empty `consolidation_proposals[]` OR non-empty `structural_notes[]`) — the `structural_notes` arm incidentally fixes a latent bug where `structural_notes`-only files previously fell into `no-actionable` and were silently dropped by callers branching on `compacted`. Explicit-paths mode now runs through per-file dispatch for under-threshold paths as well (the `skipped-below-threshold` enum value's semantic widens from "CP2 skipped entirely" to "compaction skipped because already below threshold, but CP2 still ran for the consolidation pass"); discovery mode threshold filter is unchanged — to scan small files for clusters, pass them explicitly via `--compact <path>`. New `min_cluster_size` configuration (default 3, set to a very large value such as `99999999` to disable consolidation while keeping compaction — matches the `compaction_threshold` opt-out sentinel convention). Caller wiring for `consolidation_proposals` user-gate display (`dev-workflow` Step 11 sub-step 3 gate expansion) is intentionally deferred to a follow-up subtask; existing callers see `consolidation_proposals` as an additive optional field they may safely ignore. Top-level `reason` token `"no files exceed threshold"` is renamed to `"no targets resolved"` to reflect the broadened Step CP1 step 4 semantics (an empty target set now also covers the "no explicit paths passed" case, not just the discovery-no-hits case).

## 2026-05-23

### extract-rules v1.16.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.42.0

- feat(extract-rules): **Behavior change — observation-count gating for project-level patterns in incremental modes**. 1st observation of a project-level pattern via `--from-conversation` / `--from-pr` now lands in `staging_output_dir` (default `.claude/rules-staging`, outside Claude Code's `.claude/rules/**` auto-load scope) instead of `<output_dir>/project.md` (the single hybrid file for project-level patterns). Promotion to canonical occurs on the 2nd observation in a later incremental run, or when matched by a subsequent `--update`. Language / framework / integration patterns bypass staging and land directly as before. To opt staging back into auto-load, set `staging_output_dir` to `output_dir` (or any path under `output_dir`). **Downstream automation note**: automated runs that grep `<output_dir>/project.md` for new entries immediately after `--from-pr` will see fewer entries on first run — set `staging_output_dir: <output_dir>/staging` to keep entries inside the auto-load scope, or query the staging file path explicitly.

### extract-rules v1.15.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.41.0

- feat(extract-rules): **Default change — `examples_output_dir: .claude/rules-extras`** — set `examples_output_dir: .claude/rules` (or any path under `output_dir`) in `.claude/extract-rules.local.md` or `~/.claude/extract-rules.local.md` to opt out and keep `.examples.md` co-located with rule files under `output_dir`. The new default routes `.examples.md` writes outside Claude Code's `.claude/rules/**` auto-load scope so examples no longer consume context on session start. Existing projects keep their already-written examples in place — run `Skill(extract-rules) --restructure` to migrate them to the new default location. Also fixes the SKILL.md / examples-format.md annotation that previously claimed `.examples.md` is "not auto-loaded" — that claim was based on an unverified `paths:` frontmatter assumption; the actual auto-load scope is directory-based. **Downstream automation note**: automated runs that invoke `extract-rules --update` from CI / scheduled jobs do not read CHANGELOG; on the first run after upgrading they will silently start writing examples to the new default path. Pin `examples_output_dir` explicitly in `.claude/extract-rules.local.md` if those pipelines need stable output locations.

### dev-workflow v1.40.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.40.1

- fix(dev-workflow): state custom_instructions absent-key behavior inline on Step 6 Tidy dispatch line (auto-triage #40)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 6 Tidy dispatch line passed custom_instructions through tidy's natural-language field without specifying the absent-key behavior, forcing a blank-slate executor to cross-reference Configuration to infer the omit-path. Added inline absent-key clause (omit field on unset/empty; forbid (none) / empty string / fabricated default) plus a general principle for caller-skill dispatch fields driven by optional config keys.
- fix(dev-workflow): forbid Base ref / --base-commit pass-through on Step 6 Tidy dispatch line (auto-triage #40)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 6 Tidy relied on tidy's default working-tree mode (untracked-included) for scope correctness but the dispatch line did not name that dependency. Sibling Steps 7 / 7.5 invoke their callees with --base-commit <sha>, creating an extrapolation pull that would silently switch tidy to committed-history mode and drop untracked files. Added load-bearing "Do not pass Base ref / --base-commit <sha>" clause + sibling-asymmetry rationale + general principle (ii) on default-mode-vs-sibling-convention asymmetry.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Step 6 pre-dispatch rename-sweep self-audit for synonym / derived-form residue (auto-triage #39)
  - Category: missing-branch; Completion-time integrity check caught rename target synonyms / derived forms (gerunds, nominalizations, conceptual paraphrases) left behind by mechanical search-and-replace even though Step 6 cleanup terminated with "no actionable findings". Step 6 had no rename-aware self-audit. Added new sub-step 1 (Pre-dispatch rename-sweep self-audit) firing on rename diffs; positions Step 6 as primary detection point with later integrity checks as backstop.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Callee verdict transcription is not a turn boundary clause to No-Stall Principle (auto-triage #39)
  - Category: ambiguity; § No-Stall Principle's existing rules did not cover the specific stall pattern where the orchestrator re-transcribes a callee's actionable verdict at the end of its response and stops. New clause adjacent to the no-summary-turn paragraph forbids verdict-transcription-as-turn-end, enumerates the next-action options, lists forbidden patterns ("shall I proceed?", "ここまでで一区切り" prose summaries, wait-for-"続けて"), and extends to sub-step completion prose.
- fix(dev-workflow): restructure Step 11 compaction-gate preamble with why-fired + decision-axes prefix slots (auto-triage #38)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 11 compaction approval gate preamble previously rendered 4 mechanical metrics only; empirical observation showed users misread the gate as "compaction failure report" because the reason for opening the gate was implicit. Restructured Step 11 Required slots from 4 metric items to 6 slots: slot 1 "Why this gate fired" + slot 2 "Decision axes" precede the 4 mechanical metrics. 3-5 items format constraint explicitly relaxed to 6 for Step 11. Slots 1-2 carry class-level extensibility notes for future multi-root-cause gates.
- fix(dev-workflow): add workproduct-independence + dead-on-arrival axes to Step 1.5 decomposition criteria (auto-triage #38)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 1.5 Normal sub-mode decomposition criteria were heavily weighted on the verification-path primary signal alone. Tasks with a single verification surface but independently shippable units (new skill + caller switch, foundational refactor + consuming feature) were incorrectly classified as no-decompose, requiring user pushback. Added two positive-signal axes: workproduct-independence and dead-on-arrival acceptability. Precedence section expanded with: new axes override the subtask-too-small overhead veto, atomicity veto remains absolute, multi-axis disagreement defaults to decompose-favoring.

### extract-rules v1.14.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.40.1

- fix(extract-rules): add explicit Forbidden tool calls section to --compact subagent prompt (auto-triage #38)
  - Category: missing-branch; --compact subagent prompt previously had only a soft 1-sentence contract bullet ("subagent does not call Edit directly") which the analysis subagent could ignore. Promoted to a top-level § Forbidden tool calls section with a closed enumeration of forbidden tools (Edit / Write / NotebookEdit / Bash file-write patterns), 2-layer Pattern A rationale, anti-pattern self-recognition prompt ("If you find yourself reasoning..."), and class-wide extension hook for Pattern A sibling subagents.
- fix(extract-rules): require verbatim character-class preservation in --compact mechanical_edits old_string (auto-triage #38)
  - Category: other; --compact subagent unconsciously normalized lookalike characters (fullwidth vs halfwidth parens, em-dash vs ASCII hyphen, ideographic space, ellipsis variants) during old_string extraction, producing strings that visually match but byte-mismatch the source. Edit silently skipped via no-op fallback, was misread as overlap-skip. Added a load-bearing bullet to mechanical_edits schema enumerating the character classes to preserve verbatim, the failure-mode signature (low applied_edits_count), and a self-recognition prompt.

### dev-workflow v1.40.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.40.0

- feat(dev-workflow): switch Step 6 callee from `Skill(simplify)` to `Skill(tidy)` — completes the `local-simplify-replacement` migration (paired with `tidy v1.0.0` published in `dev-workflow-bundle v1.39.3`). Step heading renamed to `Step 6: Tidy`; all SKILL.md / README.md prose references aligned with the `tidy` name. **Behavior change**: runs that previously resolved `Skill(simplify)` to upstream's renamed `code-review` skill (correctness-only since claude-code v2.1.147) now resolve to the bundle-provided `tidy` cleanup-and-fix behavior, restoring v2.1.146-era semantics. No opt-out — re-pin to `dev-workflow-bundle v1.39.x` to keep the prior callee.

### tidy v1.0.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.39.3

- feat(tidy): introduce new bundle skill that replicates the cleanup-and-fix behavior dropped from upstream simplify in claude-code v2.1.147. Pattern A (Skill wrapper + Agent dispatch + main-thread Edit + iteration loop + fenced JSON return contract); siblings with `verify-diff` / `skill-review`. Scope expands beyond `skill-review`'s `skills/<name>/` filter to cover all changed files (tracked + untracked, with cross-ecosystem lockfile / build-artifact / binary exclusion). Step 6 of `dev-workflow` will be wired to `Skill(tidy)` in a follow-up subtask.

## 2026-05-21

### ask-peer v2.2.8 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.39.2

- fix(ask-peer): extend state-variable lifecycle audit to persistence-layer state and add mitigation-vs-root-cause discrimination (auto-triage #36)
  - Category: missing-branch; Planning bullet's (iii) state-variable lifecycle clause covered counter / flag / accumulator but did not name persistence-layer state records whose add / start write must be symmetrically matched by completion / failure / empty-state-arrival writes — reviewers thus surfaced symptom-mitigation fixes (discard stale entries on read) without flagging the underlying save-on-completion asymmetry. (iii) extended to include "persistent state record" + persistence-layer write asymmetry example, and new (iv) clause added requiring reviewers to flag mitigation-only fixes as partial and demand identifying the state-machine asymmetry that produced the symptom.

### dev-workflow v1.39.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.39.2

- fix(dev-workflow): add Sub-skill natural-language argument minimalism bullet to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #37)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 2 § Simplicity self-audit had no bullet warning that long contextualized natural-language preambles passed to a sub-skill can override the callee's procedural fallbacks and cause empty-input early-termination — a non-obvious property the existing guidance did not name. New bullet establishes short scope-only sentence as the default, names the three sub-rules (minimum scope only / extra context only when strictly required / state preparation as the fallback), and explains the prompt-injection-weight mechanism.
- fix(dev-workflow): extend § Progress Visibility with Mid-chain visibility rule for chained sub-skill dispatches (auto-triage #37)
  - Category: missing-branch; § Progress Visibility covered only single pre-dispatch status messages, leaving the user-visibility window during chained sub-skill phases (feasibility checks, routine dispatch loops, multi-call interpretation) unhandled — the gap between dispatches could span multiple silent turns. New Mid-chain visibility clause requires a one-line current-location report at semantic checkpoints between dispatches, bound by three stall-preventing constraints (same-turn prose / phase-name+next-action only / not applied to short same-turn chains).
- fix(dev-workflow): add Negative-direction rule to plan-format.md § Localization granularity (auto-triage #37)
  - Category: ambiguity; § Localization granularity stated only positive-direction rules (Two-way rule + First-use pairing) without explicitly bounding what happens outside those categories, so defensive over-preservation could sprinkle source-language vocabulary across connective prose. New Negative-direction subsection establishes connective prose stays in the resolved language only, with three sub-rules: (a) verbatim scope is closed (machine-readable tokens / code / paths / commands / headings), (b) first-use pairing gated on translation-gap need, (c) function-word connectives stay in the resolved language only.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Symptom-mitigation vs root-cause-fix discrimination bullet to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #36)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 2 § Simplicity self-audit had no audit item for bug-fix tasks to discriminate symptom-mitigation changes (suppress the firing condition of the observed failure) from root-cause-fix changes (correct the state-machine asymmetry that produces it), so all-mitigation plans could pass author review and surface as "but why does the symptom happen?" pushback only at Step 3 reviewer iteration or Step 4 user-gate. New bullet defines the two classes with concrete examples, mandates explicit Decisions surfacing when the plan is all-mitigation (Recommendation vs Alternative + rationale), and requires the structural cause to appear in Risks even when not fixed in this scope.

## 2026-05-20

### dev-workflow v1.39.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.39.1

- fix(dev-workflow): add Experimental feature gating override bullet to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #35)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 2 § Simplicity self-audit had no bullet directing plan authors to prefer opt-in defaults when the gated feature is experimental, so sibling-consistency would push a default-enabled rollout even for unproven features. New bullet sets opt-in as the override, names experimental-marker detection signals, and states the graduation condition.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Self-application live validation bullet to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #35)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 2 § Simplicity self-audit had no audit item for the self-application case (target = running skill or same-run callee), so live-validation Test plan items were ad-hoc. New bullet defines self-application, requires identifying the immediate-exercise path, and mandates a "live validation" Test plan item citing the specific Step / sub-step / hook.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Plan-vs-allowed-tools 1:1 alignment sub-check to Step 3 (a) Scope & feasibility (auto-triage #34)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 (a) had no audit cross-referencing concrete external commands cited in the plan body against the plan's allowed-tools enumeration, so missing entries surfaced as Critical rules-review violations only at Step 7.5, forcing a mid-implementation allowed-tools rewrite. New sub-check directs the reviewer to enumerate cited commands and verify 1:1 alignment.
- fix(dev-workflow): require verbatim fenced rendering of commit body / subject / files / diff at Step 10 per-commit accept gate (auto-triage #33)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 10 sub-step 4.a (Present) listed the 4 elements but did not require each to render in a dedicated fenced code block, leaving room for prose-only "body 含め" summaries that hid material content from the user's approval decision. New closed-list sub-bullets specify Subject / Body / Files / Diff rendering rules (with `(no body)` placeholder for empty body) and explicitly forbid prose-only summaries.
- fix(dev-workflow): extend Closed-list reference sweep to entire distribution surface (auto-triage #33)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 (a) "Closed-list reference sweep" only swept SKILL.md and references/*.md, missing README user-facing guides, mirrored bundle copy directories, manifest/marketplace.json plugin entries, and test/config fixtures. Sub-check now enumerates the full distribution surface with skill-development examples (README, plugins/<bundle>/skills/<name>/, .claude-plugin/marketplace.json) in parenthesized form.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Domain-state composition explicit decomposition bullet to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #32)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 2 § Simplicity self-audit had no audit item for feature requirements defined as composition (boolean AND/OR) of multiple independent state values; plans hid the composition behind a single derived predicate and gated on one constituent only. New bullet requires explicit enumeration of constituent values in Decisions and a state-space combination table in the Test plan.

### peer v2.2.7 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.39.1

- fix(ask-peer): add structural-level deep audit to Planning focus first-dispatch priority (auto-triage #34)
  - Category: ambiguity; ask-peer's Planning focus did not require cross-reference precision, disposition vocabulary integrity, or state-variable lifecycle 4-point symmetric specification on the first review dispatch, so Critical-class structural findings surfaced at iter 2 forcing a plan rewrite and iter-count bump. New clause names the three audit items and explicitly requires them on the first dispatch.
- fix(ask-peer): add sibling-symmetry grep audit to Planning + Code Review Focus Areas (auto-triage #32)
  - Category: missing-branch; ask-peer's focus areas didn't require active grep + tabulation across existing components sharing label / identifier / surface text / domain concept with the new addition, so plans and diffs passed surface-level review while same-text-different-side-effect asymmetry surfaced only at integration / live-environment time. New clause directs reviewer to grep + tabulate firing conditions and side effects (mirrored to Code bullet via short cross-reference).

### dev-workflow v1.39.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.39.0

- feat(dev-workflow): add `compact_rules` config (default `false`) gating Step 11 sub-step 3 (Char-count compaction gate). **Default: disabled** — the compaction mode added in v1.38.0 is currently experimental; set `compact_rules: true` in `.claude/dev-workflow.md` or `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md` to opt in per project. When disabled (default), `Skill(extract-rules) --compact` is never invoked, the compaction approval gate never opens, and § Completion's compaction reminder is automatically omitted. **Behavior change from v1.38.0**: users who adopted v1.38.0 compaction must explicitly set `compact_rules: true` to retain that behavior.

### extract-rules v1.14.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.38.0

- feat(extract-rules): add Compaction Mode (`--compact`) — compacts `<output_dir>/**/*.md` files that exceed `compaction_threshold` (default `32000` chars, 80% of Claude Code's 40k per-file warning observed in 2.1.x). Pattern A iteration loop (max_iterations=2 default) with subagent-side `mechanical_edits` / `structural_notes` schema and main-thread `Edit` application. Heuristics: class-level extension merge / similar-entry merge / example reference extraction / one-shot incident dropout. Fenced JSON return contract emitted for sub-skill caller dispatch (used by `dev-workflow` Step 11 char-count compaction gate).
- feat(extract-rules): add `compaction_threshold` setting to `extract-rules.local.md` (default `32000`). Set to a very large number (e.g. `99999999`) to opt out of compaction.

### dev-workflow v1.38.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.38.0

- feat(dev-workflow): add Step 11 char-count compaction gate — invokes `Skill(extract-rules) --compact` (no file arguments; extract-rules resolves the target set internally). **Default: enabled** — set `compaction_threshold: 99999999` in `.claude/extract-rules.local.md` (or `~/.claude/extract-rules.local.md`) to opt out. The gate presents per-file diff under a new user-approval gate (`Step 11 compaction approval gate`); accept keeps working-tree changes (file count surfaced via the new Completion-summary "Step 11 compaction reminder" line), reject reverts via `git checkout HEAD --`, `cancel` leaves the working tree as-is per Step 10's `Mid-loop cancel` semantic, and `adjust` follows Step 11's own three-case closed list (per-file disposition / clarification / other) rather than Step 10's Mid-loop adjust branches.
- feat(dev-workflow): add Step 11 compaction approval gate to the `§ No-Stall Principle` explicit-user-gates closed list. `references/plan-format.md` § User-gate summary preamble's `Applies to:` list extended to include this gate with its own Required / Optional content slots (file count with `applied_edits_count > 0`, total chars saved, `per_file_status` breakdown, over-threshold count; structural_notes count and self-application warning are Optional).

### dev-workflow v1.37.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.37.0

- feat(dev-workflow): add `ask-agy` to the supported reviewer closed list.

### ask-agy v1.0.0

- New skill: `ask-agy` wraps the `agy` (Antigravity) CLI for getting a second opinion.

## 2026-05-19

### dev-workflow v1.36.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.36.2

- fix(dev-workflow): add Phase-boundary self-audit to Step 1 TodoWrite registration (auto-triage #31)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 1 sub-step 7 registered all phases in TodoWrite but did not enforce phase-completion audit at each top-level Step boundary, so phases like Step 6 Simplify could be silently skipped. Added a Phase-boundary self-audit clause: name the entering Step number and verify the prior Step's TodoWrite row is `completed` before advancing.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Rejection self-question to Step 8 to override Minor-label rejections on readability findings (auto-triage #30)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 8 sub-step 3 allowed rejecting Minor-label findings on the label alone, even for code-intent / readability / placement-consistency findings users typically re-raise at the commit gate. Added a Rejection self-question sub-bullet: apply on yes/ambiguous, reject only on confident-no.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Natural-language quality self-check to Step 8 post-fix hooks (auto-triage #30)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 8 fix loops added natural-language content (comments, config annotations, error messages) without any quality self-check. Step 7 / Step 7.5 cannot evaluate NL quality, so awkward additions slipped to the commit gate. Added a Natural-language quality self-check sub-bullet after Prose-integrity self-check.
- fix(dev-workflow): forbid inline substitution of Step 7.5 Skill(rules-review) on subjective scope judgment (auto-triage #30)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 7.5 step 1 did not prohibit the agent self-judging "minimum scope, do inline" and replacing the external `Skill(rules-review)` call. Tightened step 1 to "Always invoke" + explicit ban on scope / size / complexity substitution, with the Prerequisites fallback preserved for objective skill unavailability only.
- fix(dev-workflow): enforce always-run Step 3 with closed-list handling for user-provided analysis (auto-triage #29)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 had no branch for "user task prompt already contained design analysis" and the agent skipped Step 3 unilaterally. Added an Always-run preamble + closed-list of 3 handling rules: (i) reviewer skill always invoked, (ii) user analysis fed into dispatch payload as additional context, (iii) explicit user override is the only skip path with a Completion-summary warning.
- fix(dev-workflow): explicit Responsibility scope for Step 7.5 rules-review vs Step 6 / Step 8 (auto-triage #29)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 7.5 / Step 6 Simplify / Step 8 Code Review responsibility boundary for rule compliance was implicit. Added a Responsibility scope section to Step 7.5 preamble naming Step 7.5 as owner of the `.claude/rules/` mechanical walk (hard rule strict / intent-style best-effort), Step 6 / Step 8 carve-outs, and Step 7.5 as authoritative on duplicate flags.

### peer v2.2.6 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.36.2

- fix(ask-peer): require a recommended default for functionally-equivalent style alternatives (auto-triage #31)
  - Category: missing-branch; Core Principles "Provide concrete alternatives" did not require the reviewer to name a recommended default when the alternatives are functionally equivalent (same observable behavior, differing only in placement / ordering / style), so callers round-tripped on coin-flip decisions. Extended the bullet to require a recommended default (including "keep as-is").
- fix(ask-peer): require surfacing at least one upper-level design alternative during plan review (auto-triage #31)
  - Category: missing-branch; Planning review focus area covered scope / risks / simpler approaches / numerical / operational reality but did not require the reviewer to surface upper-level design alternatives at the structural layer. Added an "upper-level design alternatives" clause naming concrete categories (firing-point selection, responsibility split, suppression-flag necessity, lifecycle boundary choices).
- fix(ask-peer): mark reviewer sample artifacts as discussion templates rather than finished output (auto-triage #30)
  - Category: other; Reviewer-provided code / comment / wording examples calibrated for the consultation dialogue were copy-pasted verbatim into code where they read as too verbose or off-tone. Added a Communication Style bullet directing the reviewer to mark sample artifacts as discussion templates with hedge phrasing, register-mismatch reminder, and defer-final-wording-to-implementer disposition.

### rules-review v1.1.4 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.36.2

- fix(rules-review): add scope-note to compliant Output Format to remind users about unwritten conventions (auto-triage #31)
  - Category: ambiguity; When rules-review concluded "No rule violations found", users had no signal that the check covers only documented `.claude/rules/` rules; unwritten project-specific vocabulary / style conventions remained invisible. Added a Scope note blockquote outside the fenced output template so the literal `No rule violations found` runtime string stays unchanged (preserves exact-match contract per § 6. Aggregate Results) while reader-facing documentation surfaces the limitation and guides to `Skill(extract-rules)`.

## 2026-05-18

### dev-workflow v1.36.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.36.1

- fix(dev-workflow): add Upstream-handoff agreement override audit to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #27)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 2 § Simplicity self-audit had no branch to surface plan-vs-prior-session-agreed-upstream-document overrides as Decisions items, so reviewer-driven overrides reached Step 4 user gate without explicit user-decision opportunity. New bullet enumerates the diff in Decisions with uphold/overwrite Recommendation/Alternative and an explicit override marker.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Temporary-workaround minimal coupling audit to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #27)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 2 § Simplicity self-audit had no audit item for declared-temporary plan elements, so initial drafts defaulted to permanent-element-depth integration and triggered user pushback. New bullet sets minimal coupling as first-class Recommendation, deep integration as Alternative with explicit removal-cost rationale, and requires Removability as a Risks evaluation axis.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Pre-existing vs regression discrimination to Step 7 test_commands loop (auto-triage #27)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 7 retry path had no formal sub-step to discriminate test-skill TEST_FAILED reports as regression vs pre-existing. New sub-bullet names the two paths (trust test-skill's own classification if present; otherwise re-run at base-commit), defines the informational disposition for pre-existing failures (not counted toward retry budget, not auto-fixed), and recommends the regression-vs-pre-existing return contract as a verification-class skill convention.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Late-stage scaffolding self-audit to Step 5 Implement (auto-triage #27)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 5 had no explicit guidance to re-apply Step 2 § Simplicity self-audit rigor to structural elements newly added during implementation. Late-stage scaffolding correctness gaps surfaced first at Step 8 iter 1. New item 3 names 4 audit legs (sibling symmetry, error-path symmetry, boundary-value coverage, reference-site sweep) for newly introduced elements.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Cross-file closed-list extension audit to Step 3 (a) (auto-triage #26)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 (a) review had no explicit sub-check for closed lists mirrored across SKILL.md + references/*.md sibling files. Mirror copies drifted past Step 3 review. New sub-check requires Test plan to enumerate every reference site as a sweep target.
- fix(dev-workflow): add State-variable lifecycle completeness to Step 3 (c) Completeness (auto-triage #26)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 (c) had no explicit sub-check requiring Design to symmetrically specify init / advance / non-advance / reference-sites for new state variables. Counter increment semantics surfaced only at Step 8 iter 2 as Major findings. New sub-check enumerates the 4 lifecycle points with symmetric success/failure path specification as the general principle.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Internal convention citation verification to Step 3 (a) (auto-triage #26)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 3 (a) Premise challenge required verification only for external requirements / known bugs / project rules — internal-convention citations could pass through without primary-source verification. New sub-check requires reviewer to verify via grep/Read; if not found, treat as new convention requiring full justification.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Internal cross-reference stability to Step 3 (a) (auto-triage #26)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 3 (a) did not actively check for raw sub-step number references in cross-ref prose. Rules-compliance violation surfaced only at Step 7.5. New sub-check requires references to use stable phrase anchors (section headings, bold-prose labels, quoted phrases) — refactor-resilient anchoring as general principle.
- fix(dev-workflow): add CHANGELOG signal placement check to Step 3 (c) (auto-triage #26)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 had no self-audit for CHANGELOG signal placement when plan flips a distributed default. Behavior-change signals could end up buried in late bullets. New sub-check verifies first-line visibility, opt-out colocation, and bump-strength alignment on three axes.
- fix(dev-workflow): add External CLI behavior verification to Step 3 (a) (auto-triage #26)
  - Category: missing-branch; Shell content portability check covered shell-level concerns but not CLI sub-command semantics (git diff omits untracked, porcelain C-quoting, amend pre-staging, gh list truncation). New sub-check extends External library primary-source verification (category (e)) to CLI/shell domain. Unverified items lift to Risks as stale-CLI-assumption.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Closed-list reference sweep to Step 3 (c) (auto-triage #26)
  - Category: ambiguity; Closed-list modifications (enum / branch set / gate count / status token) needed an explicit sweep across reference sites (count claims, sibling enum fields, disposition mapping tables, render rules). New sub-check requires class-level extension audit across all reference sites; canonical change is necessary but not sufficient.

### dev-workflow v1.36.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.36.0

- feat(dev-workflow): relax `test_commands` from fixed `["Skill(run-tests)"]` to a list-replace key (default unchanged; higher-priority config layer's list replaces lower as a whole — no item-level merge or dedup). Project config can append additional structural-check skills. Step 7 iterates the list in order; any TEST_FAILED / EXECUTION_ERROR halts the loop immediately.

## 2026-05-17

### dev-workflow v1.35.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.35.0

- feat(dev-workflow): introduce Step 10 Interactive Commits and reorder post-Step-8 phases. **Default: enabled** — set `interactive_commits: false` in `.claude/dev-workflow.md` or `~/.claude/dev-workflow.local.md` to opt out. The new step runs after `hooks.on_complete` and proposes commit groupings + messages for user approval, then iterates per-commit. `extract-rules` and `self-retrospective` now run after the commit phase. If your downstream automation relies on `/dev-workflow` ending with an uncommitted tree (e.g. an external CI that commits and pushes for you), set `interactive_commits: false`.
- feat(dev-workflow): `hooks.on_complete` now executes as Step 9 (before extract-rules), shifted from its former post-Update-Rules timing. Hook entries that assumed rules had already been updated at hook-run time may need to be revisited.
- feat(dev-workflow): renumber post-Step-8 phases to monotonic execution order — old `Step 9` (Update Rules) → `Step 11`, old `Step 9.5` (Self-Retrospective) → `Step 11.5`, old `Step 10` (Completion Hooks) → `Step 9`. All cross-references in SKILL.md and `references/self-retrospective.md` updated.

## 2026-05-15

### dev-workflow v1.34.19 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.19

- fix(dev-workflow): add harmless-class bypass to Step 7 scope-drift guard (auto-triage #25)
  - Category: missing-branch; Scope-drift guard blocked on all out-of-scope changes without classifying whether they were harmless (whitespace/comment-only, ≤5 lines, formatter-attributable). Added 3-condition bypass so trivial formatting drift proceeds automatically with a one-line note.
- fix(dev-workflow): pass subtask scope boundaries to Step 3 / Step 8 reviewer (auto-triage #25)
  - Category: missing-branch; When a state file was active, plan reviewer and code reviewer were not informed of the current subtask's scope or what other subtasks covered, causing false-positive findings about missing out-of-scope functionality. Added subtask scope instruction to both reviewer dispatch steps.
- fix(dev-workflow): add TDD-conflict resolution for characterization test subtasks (auto-triage #25)
  - Category: missing-branch; When custom_instructions included a TDD-style requirement, subtasks adding characterization/coverage tests for existing behavior triggered a TDD-loop conflict. Added keyword-based detection and explicit TDD-loop-external declaration to Step 2 plan creation.
- fix(dev-workflow): add e2e coverage check to Step 3 Plan Review category (c) (auto-triage #25)
  - Category: missing-branch; Plan Review completeness check lacked an e2e/integration coverage verification item. Changes affecting user-visible interactions or role-based authorization flows could pass review without an e2e test plan.
- fix(dev-workflow): add no-summary-turn constraint at review-return boundaries (auto-triage #24)
  - Category: missing-branch; No-Stall Principle did not explicitly prohibit summary-only turns when a reviewer or sub-skill returned a semantically-empty result. Added paragraph banning verdict lists, conclusion paragraphs, and "shall I proceed?" sentences at review-return transition boundaries.
- fix(dev-workflow): add structural compliance as first Step 2 self-check item (auto-triage #24)
  - Category: missing-branch; Structural compliance (required sections, heading levels, no extra sections) was not the first self-check item and lacked a "stop here and restructure" gate. Also added template-skeleton-first guidance for plans seeded from carry-over documents.
- fix(dev-workflow): add planning-draft recovery branch to Resume sub-mode schema validation (auto-triage #23)
  - Category: missing-branch; --resume with a file lacking YAML frontmatter or missing required keys would fatal-stop instead of treating the file as an inherited planning draft. Added step 3a planning-draft recovery that continues to Normal sub-mode with the document as background context.

### peer v2.2.5

- fix(ask-peer): respect explicit scope boundaries in subtask review (auto-triage #23)
  - Category: missing-branch; Peer reviewer had no instruction to honor explicit in-scope boundaries from consultation requests, causing out-of-scope subtask functionality to be reported as Critical/Major findings. Added Scope boundary discipline to the Peer Agent Personality.

### rules-review v1.1.3

- fix(rules-review): add rule-doc-drift classification for stale rule documents (auto-triage #23)
  - Category: missing-branch; When code followed a consistent pattern across 3+ diff locations but the rule document described different behavior, the reviewer classified it as a code violation rather than a rule-doc-drift finding. Added classification field and route-to-extract-rules recommendation for the drift case.

## 2026-05-14

### dev-workflow v1.34.18 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.18

- fix(dev-workflow): add prerequisites fallback branch to Step 7.5 (auto-triage #22)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 7.5 lacked a defined fallback branch when `check_commands` is undefined or empty, leaving executor behavior unspecified. Added explicit continuation flow so the skill proceeds deterministically when no check commands are configured.
- fix(dev-workflow): clarify bulk-vs-split execution strategy default in Step 7.5 (auto-triage #22)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 7.5 execution strategy defaulted to bulk-run without documenting the rationale or the conditions under which split execution is appropriate. Added bulk-first default with split-on-error fallback and explicit criteria for when split-first is the better choice.
- fix(dev-workflow): add progress visibility instructions to Step 7.5 (auto-triage #22)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 7.5 provided no guidance on what to output during command execution, leaving executor choice between silent execution and verbose logging undefined. Added explicit progress display instructions covering command number, result, and error details.
- fix(dev-workflow): add Cross-component sibling coverage check to Step 3 Plan Review (auto-triage #22)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 scope & feasibility category lacked a sub-check for structural patterns shared across sibling components, leaving reviewers without guidance to flag plans that fix one component while leaving affected siblings unchanged. Added Cross-component sibling coverage sub-check with three directions: structural-fix propagation, new-component alignment, and intra-patch uniformity.

### peer v2.2.4 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.18

- fix(ask-peer): add error handling section for subagent dispatch failures (auto-triage #22)
  - Category: missing-branch; ask-peer had no defined behavior when subagent dispatch fails due to transient errors (HTTP 5xx, timeout, or empty response). Added `## Error Handling` section specifying retry-once policy, failure surfacing to the caller, and prohibition on autonomous skill rerouting.

## 2026-05-12

### dev-workflow v1.34.17 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.17

- fix(dev-workflow): add prose-language self-audit step in Step 4 before ExitPlanMode (auto-triage #21)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 4 lacked an explicit self-audit step to verify that prose output language conforms to the resolved `language` setting before calling `ExitPlanMode`. Added the self-audit requirement so the plan author catches language mismatches before the approval gate.
- fix(dev-workflow): record class-level sweep outcome in next-iteration summary (auto-triage #21)
  - Category: missing-branch; The next-iteration summary in Step 8 Code Review did not record the outcome of the class-level sweep, leaving the reviewer unable to distinguish "sweep ran and found nothing" from "sweep was skipped". Added explicit recording of class-level sweep result so subsequent iters have an auditable trace.
- fix(dev-workflow): Add user-visible diagnostic when Plan Review incomplete (auto-triage #21)
  - Category: missing-branch; When Plan Review (Step 3) ended without all findings resolved, no user-visible diagnostic was emitted — the workflow could silently advance with unresolved findings. Added a diagnostic summary when the Plan Review exits with outstanding items.
- fix(dev-workflow): Add Premise challenge clause to Step 3 (a) Scope & feasibility (auto-triage #20)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 reviewer category (a) Scope & feasibility lacked a lens for challenging unsupported constraints, scope boundaries, and strictness levels in the Recommendation. Any constraint whose origin cannot be identified in an external requirement, known bug, or existing project rule must now be surfaced as a finding with at least one relaxed or eliminated alternative, so the plan author can populate the relevant Decisions `Alternative` field.
- fix(dev-workflow): Add Collection-predicate boundary cases to Step 3 (c) Completeness (auto-triage #20)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 reviewer category (c) Completeness had no guidance for checking all/every and any/some predicates over per-element classification results. Vacuous-truth gaps (empty set, all-same-classification, mixed-classification) silently passed plan review. Added Collection-predicate boundary cases check requiring reviewers to trace predicates through all three boundary scenarios.
- fix(dev-workflow): Add context-compaction recovery step to Step 1 (auto-triage #19)
  - Category: missing-branch; When session context is compacted before Step 1 runs in the current turn, skip-condition judgments (e.g. whether `self_retrospective.feedback` is set, whether `hooks.on_complete` is configured) relied on stale cached values from the compaction summary rather than the actual merged config. Added item 8 instructing re-read of all configuration files from disk after context compaction to ensure skip conditions are evaluated against the actual config state.

### extract-rules v1.13.3 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.17

- fix(extract-rules): Add item 4 to Step C4 to skip routine pattern re-application (auto-triage #19)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step C4 lacked guidance to distinguish user-directed design decisions from mechanical code following (symmetric duplication, template expansion, mechanical extension of an existing structure). Subagents were over-extracting patterns added without user guidance or correction. Added item 4 instructing the subagent to skip routine re-application and extract only when a new design decision was made, an exceptional case was handled, or the user explicitly corrected or redirected the approach.

## 2026-05-09

### dev-workflow v1.34.16 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.16

- fix(dev-workflow): semantic judgment of reviewer return at Step 3 / Step 8 (auto-triage #16 followup)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 3 / Step 8 reviewer-return handlers used exact-string matching (`"No actionable findings"`), which stalled the orchestrator when `Skill(ask-peer)` or other free-form-prose reviewers returned natural-language Markdown verdicts that did not contain that exact phrase. Replaced with semantic judgment matching Step 7.5's existing pattern (trust the orchestrator's natural-language interpretation, do not rely on exact-phrase matching since reviewer phrasing varies). Caller-side fix for the original auto-triage #16 F5 stall problem; the earlier callee-side fix (ask-peer return contract) was reverted because forcing a review-specific JSON schema onto a general-purpose consultation skill was the wrong layer of abstraction.

### dev-workflow v1.34.15 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.15

- fix(dev-workflow): add result-recovery branch to Step 6 for unobservable Simplify output (auto-triage #17)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 6 lacked a recovery branch when context compaction occurred during/after `Skill(simplify)`, making the result unobservable. Added bullet 3 instructing inspection of `git diff <base-commit>`: if changes attributable to a simplification pass are visible, treat simplify as completed and proceed; otherwise re-execute `Skill(simplify)` once (inspection-and-fix-class skills are idempotent) before Step 7.
- fix(dev-workflow): extend class-level extension audit to Critical/Major-severity findings (auto-triage #16)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 8 class-level extension audit only triggered after Critical-severity fixes, so Major-severity findings whose fix addresses a structural pattern (e.g. negation-style branch description) escaped class-level scan and re-surfaced in subsequent iters as the same defect at a sibling location. Extended the trigger to include Major-severity findings whose fix addresses a structural pattern (closed enums, shared safety-rail callers, parallel handlers, etc.) so iter-1 sibling instances are caught in the same iter as the named instance.
- fix(dev-workflow): extend Simplify-revival check to iter 1 when Step 6 ran (auto-triage #16)
  - Category: missing-branch; Simplify-revival check fired only at iter k≥2, but iter-1 fixes can already re-introduce narration / preamble / redundant prose that an earlier Step 6 Simplify pass deliberately removed (fix patches see only the line-level diff). Extended to iter k≥1 when Step 6 ran earlier in this session (iter k≥2 otherwise) so first-iter fixes are also audited against Simplify deletions.

### rules-review v1.1.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.15

- fix(rules-review): add cross-file scope expansion to reviewer prompt (auto-triage #15)
  - Category: wrong-default; Reviewer prompt's `**Scope**` statement implicitly framed checks as same-file, causing cross-file references / imports / shared-contract violations to be missed in cycle 1 and only caught in cycle 2 as low-confidence findings. Added an explicit cross-file scope clause: when a rule's text doesn't restrict to a single file (no "in this file" / "within this file" / equivalent limiting phrase), apply it across all changed files in the diff including cross-file references, imports, and shared contracts. Also added an explicit cycle 1 requirement — deferring cross-file rule application to a later cycle is a defect, not expected behavior.

### dev-workflow v1.34.14 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.14

- fix(dev-workflow): add empty-Decisions buried-decisions self-check gate (auto-triage #16)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 2 self-check lacked an explicit branch for the case where Decisions renders a no-decisions fixed sentence, leaving buried (a)+(b)-criterion items in Design undetected before advancing to Step 3.

## 2026-05-08

### dev-workflow v1.34.13 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.13

- fix(dev-workflow): replace progressive disclosure with full-plan + approval-summary presentation order in Step 4
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 4 used a progressive disclosure protocol (section inventory with on-demand expansion) that relied on HTML `<details>` tags in the VSCode extension environment, where they rendered as plain text. Additionally, the `ExitPlanMode` call was not mandated in the same turn as the plan text output, causing the approval modal to not appear — making the workflow look stalled with no visible way to approve. Replaced `§ Progressive disclosure at user-gates` with `§ Step 4 presentation order`: plan body renders in full in natural reading order (Overview → Decisions → Design → Test plan → Risks), followed by a `---` separator and an approval summary (preamble + guidance line) at the bottom where the chat viewport lands. Added explicit mandate that `ExitPlanMode` must be called in the same turn as the plan output. Updated guidance lines to remove "expand" references, removed stale "section inventory" mentions from `§ Localization granularity` and the `language` config description, and updated `§ User-gate summary preamble` to describe per-gate preamble positioning.

## 2026-05-07

### dev-workflow v1.34.12 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.12

- feat(dev-workflow): add progressive disclosure protocol for Step 4 and localization granularity for all user-facing prose
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 4 plan approval presented the full plan body by default, requiring users to scan the entire content before forming a decision. Added `§ Progressive disclosure at user-gates` to `references/plan-format.md` defining a default output sequence (summary preamble → guidance line → section inventory) with on-demand section expansion for Step 4. Step 7.5 and Step 8 retain direct presentation (preamble + content) since violation/finding lists are typically short. Also added `§ Localization granularity` codifying the two-way translate/preserve-verbatim boundary for all user-facing prose with first-use pairing and paired bilingual samples. Updated Step 4.1 in `SKILL.md` to reference the new protocol, Step 7.5.d and Step 8.4 to reference § Localization granularity directly, and Completion to output in the resolved language. Expanded the `language` config bullet to cover preambles, section inventory, and Completion summary.

## 2026-05-06

### dev-workflow v1.34.11 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.11

- fix(dev-workflow): add shell content portability check to Step 3 Plan Review category (a) (auto-triage #14)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3 reviewer categories had no explicit lens for shell portability / quoting / expansion / shell-flavor differences on plans containing shell content, surfacing such issues only at iter 2. New clause in category (a) Scope & feasibility names quoting / expansion / special-character handling / shell-flavor differences with concrete examples (zsh `nomatch` on unquoted globs, bash vs. POSIX drift) so iter-1 reviewers have a checkable signal at plan time rather than at Step 7.
- fix(dev-workflow): add intra-patch self-duplication audit direction (iii) to Step 2 Cross-component pattern alignment (auto-triage #14)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 2 Simplicity self-audit's Cross-component pattern alignment bullet covered (i) propagating a fix outward and (ii) aligning a new component inward but had no explicit lens for "this very change itself lands the same processing pattern at multiple call sites within one patch". Same-class defects within a patch slipped past Step 2 and surfaced only as Step 8 class-level extension findings. New (iii) Intra-patch self-duplication direction names shared validators / common error handling / mirrored formatting-serialization logic at multiple call sites within one change and links back to (i)'s blast-radius treatment, with skill-development examples (producer / consumer JSON parse pattern, return-contract across callees) in parentheses.
- fix(dev-workflow): add prose-integrity self-check to Step 8 per-iteration discipline (auto-triage #14)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 8 per-iteration discipline only mandated mechanical re-runs (Step 7 / Step 7.5) after a fix; prose semantic breakage (mid-word sentence cuts, broken logical connectives, paragraph-logic breakage) introduced by line-level fix patches surfaced only at iter k+1 as Major findings, costing an extra iter. New Prose-integrity self-check (post-fix) bullet names the three failure modes with concrete connective examples (`however` / `therefore` / `because` / `but`) so iter-1 agents catch breakage before the next reviewer dispatch.

### dev-workflow v1.34.10 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.10

- feat(dev-workflow): emit Producer version line in self-retrospective issue body
  - Category: missing-branch; Retrospective issue bodies carried no record of which `dev-workflow` version produced them, leaving the triage routine unable to distinguish stale issues (already-fixed in a later release) from current ones. Added a `**Producer version:** dev-workflow v<X.Y.Z>` line directly under the body header in `references/self-retrospective.md` § 4 Assemble — resolved from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` via `jq` with a literal `unknown` fallback when the file or entry is missing. Consumer-side stale-issue handling (regex extract, version-aware reject path with `(i)` CHANGELOG entry + `(ii)` SKILL.md cite gates and either-leg doubt fall-through to standard checklist) lives in the project-local `dev-workflow-triage` skill, where it can evolve independently of the bundle.

## 2026-05-05

### dev-workflow v1.34.9 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.9

- fix(dev-workflow): add Step 3 Plan Review return-point no-stall reminder mirroring Step 8 (auto-triage #13)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 3's iteration loop lacked the inline `Return-point no-stall reminder` bullet that Step 8 already carries, so the no-stall discipline only fired via the abstract `§ No-Stall Principle` section, not at the decision moment. Added a sibling-mirrored reminder that enumerates reviewer outcomes as a closed-list and names case-specific next actions, with stable cross-reference to `§ No-Stall Principle`.

### dev-workflow v1.34.8 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.8

- feat(dev-workflow): add user-gate summary preamble convention to Step 4 / Step 7.5 / Step 8
  - Category: ambiguity; The three user-judgment gates presented structured content without a TL;DR layer, leaving users to scan the full structured content before forming an overall picture. Added a `§ User-gate summary preamble` section to `references/plan-format.md` and one-line references from each of the three gate steps in `SKILL.md`.

## 2026-05-03

### dev-workflow v1.34.7 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.7

- fix(dev-workflow): add post-Critical-fix class-level extension audit to Step 8 iteration loop (auto-triage #12)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 8 step 3 had no explicit instruction to scan the rest of the diff for instances of the same defect class after a Critical-severity fix, leaving fixes scoped to the single named instance even when the class spanned the diff. Added an inline self-audit bullet sequenced before the modified-vs-rejected branches, with same-defect-class characterization (same operation / broken assumption / side-effect pattern) and concrete examples in parentheses.
- fix(dev-workflow): augment plan-format Step 2 self-check with promotion cues for buried Decisions (auto-triage #12)
  - Category: wrong-default; The buried-decisions checkbox previously gave no concrete cue for spotting a Design-buried judgment, so author self-check rarely caught what Step 3 external review later flagged. Added a closed-list of three promotion cues (why-X-over-Y / fixed-value-or-timing rationale, new enum without per-member necessity, (a)+(b)-passing choice missing an Alternative line) that operationalize the (a)+(b) criterion at detection time.

### dev-workflow v1.34.6 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.6

- fix(dev-workflow): cover new-component alignment direction in Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #11)
  - Category: missing-branch; The Step 2 Simplicity self-audit's `Cross-component structural-blast-radius` bullet only covered the "propagate fix outward" direction; the symmetric "align new component inward" branch was absent, surfacing late as Step 3 reviewer or Step 4 user pushback. Renamed to `Cross-component pattern alignment` and rewrote to audit both alignment directions explicitly, with skill-development examples kept in parentheses.
- fix(dev-workflow): add consistency-with-siblings rationale check to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #11)
  - Category: wrong-default; Step 2 Simplicity self-audit had no branch for plan elements whose primary rationale is "align with existing sibling implementations / for consistency" alone, leaving lighter alternatives unsurfaced and divergence-cost notes implicit. Added a new bullet that triggers on this rationale, requires lighter alternatives in parallel in Decisions, and requires a one-line cost-of-divergence record when consistency is chosen.

### dev-workflow v1.34.5 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.5

- fix(dev-workflow): add Distribution-aware fix direction guidance to retrospective producer §3 Sanitization to prevent skill-development vocabulary leak into bundle skills' SKILL.md prose (subtask 2 of meta-scope-leak)
  - Category: wrong-default; The producer's §3 "Keep as-is" line allowed `suggested fix directions expressed in skill-level vocabulary` by default. The triage applier transcribes those directions mostly verbatim into target SKILL.md prose, so skill-development vocabulary leaked into bundle skills' user-visible distribution surface. Added a `§ Distribution-aware fix direction (bundle skill targets)` sub-section requiring abstract-principle-first phrasing with skill-development examples in parens when the target is one of the bundle skills and the fix lands in SKILL.md / references prose. The corresponding source-of-truth rule was added to `.claude/rules/project.rules.md` § SKILL.md の配布性 with a Good/Bad example in `.claude/rules/project.rules.examples.md`.
- chore(release): synchronize dev-workflow and dev-workflow-bundle plugin versions to v1.34.5 (dev-workflow +2 jump from v1.34.3, dev-workflow-bundle +1 from v1.34.4 — pair-bump alignment)

### ask-peer v2.2.3 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.4

- fix(ask-peer): generalize peer reviewer "operational reality" prompt to remove skill-bundle internal vocabulary (subtask 1 of meta-scope-leak)
  - Category: wrong-default; The peer personality "Planning" focus area inherited `subagent dispatch and time budgets` / `sub-dispatches` from auto-triage #6, which defaulted to skill-bundle internal vocabulary instead of language-agnostic wording. These tokens confuse general-purpose project reviewers. Replaced with `compute and time budgets` / `operations`; the `N × M` sanity-check example survives.

## 2026-04-30

### ask-peer v2.2.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.3

- fix(ask-peer): add numerical self-consistency and operational-reality observations to plan review (auto-triage #6)
  - Category: missing-branch; Plan reviews missed (i) numerical off-by-one between plan body counts and TodoWrite reality, and (ii) the operational feasibility of upper-bound limits given subagent dispatch overhead. Extended the Planning focus area in the peer-personality block to enumerate both observations.

### dev-workflow v1.34.3 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.3

- fix(dev-workflow): make ExitPlanMode precondition explicit at Step 4 step 3 (auto-triage #7)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 3 → Step 4 ordering invariant was implicit; agent could issue `ExitPlanMode` mid-Step-3. Step 4 step 3 now names the TodoWrite precondition and the remediation when it trips.
- fix(dev-workflow): add cross-skill structural-blast-radius bullet to Step 2 Simplicity self-audit (auto-triage #7)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 2 self-audit only covered intra-plan incrementality. New bullet requires explicit scope expansion or a Risks-entry deferral when sibling skills share the same structural pattern.
- fix(dev-workflow): add cross-file consistency check to Step 3 (f) rubric (auto-triage #7)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 3 (f) covered cross-section consistency within a single plan but not cross-file consistency across multiple SKILL.md / references files. New bullet sits beside the existing cross-section check, gated on multi-file plans.
- fix(dev-workflow): add inline no-stall reminder at Step 8 iteration boundary (auto-triage #6)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 8 iteration boundaries had no inline no-stall reminder, so the agent stalled between iter k and iter k+1. Reminder enumerates reviewer outcomes in closed-list form and names the three possible next actions, all gated to "next tool call".
- fix(dev-workflow): add Simplify-revival check to Step 8 reviewer category c (auto-triage #5)
  - Category: missing-branch; Step 8 review fix cycle could silently re-introduce narration that Step 6 Simplify deliberately removed. New clause in category c. (iter k ≥ 2 only) tells the reviewer to flag that regression class.
- fix(dev-workflow): require recording cycle-to-cycle judgment drift in Step 7.5 (auto-triage #5)
  - Category: ambiguity; Step 7.5 1st/2nd cycle verdicts could legitimately differ on the same location, but the SKILL.md never required recording the reason. New clause in step 3.c covers both drift directions and requires the reason in the audit trail before completion.

### extract-rules v1.13.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.3

- fix(extract-rules): clarify examples-format reference direction is one-way (auto-triage #5)
  - Category: wrong-default; Examples-file generation defaulted to emitting a self-reference link at the end because the format spec did not state the reference direction explicitly. New clause forbids self-links and binds templates / subagent prompts to omit the section.

### rules-review v1.1.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.3

- fix(rules-review): add explicit scope policy to reviewer prompt (auto-triage #5)
  - Category: ambiguity; Reviewer prompt did not state whether rules apply diff-only or file-wide. New "Scope" clause makes diff-only the default, with an explicit escape when the rule text demands file-wide consistency.

### extract-rules v1.13.1

- docs(extract-rules): Translate remaining Japanese comments in the Usage block to English
  - The `/extract-rules --from-pr` examples in `## Usage` carried Japanese comments (`カレントリポのPR指定`, `他リポのPR指定（URL形式も可）`, `範囲指定（カレントリポ）`, `範囲指定（他リポ）`, `複数指定可（スペース区切り）→ 横断分析で組織重視の原則を検出`). Project rules require distributed artifacts (SKILL.md included) to be in English; the comments now read `PR in current repo`, `PR in another repo (URL form also accepted)`, `PR range (current repo)`, `PR range (another repo)`, and `Multiple specs allowed (space-separated) → cross-analysis detects org-wide principles`. No behavioral change

### dev-workflow v1.34.2 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.2

- fix(dev-workflow): Require repo-wide grep before drafting plans for version/identifier string replacement tasks
  - Step 2 sub-step 3 gains a new bullet: when the core operation is replacing a specific version string, identifier, or constant across the project (e.g. version bump, rename, migration), grep the entire repository for the old value before drafting the plan and enumerate the complete list of affected files in the Design section. Missing even one location is the primary regression source for this task class — surfacing the full target set at plan time blocks the "we forgot a place" failure mode rather than catching it at Step 7
- fix(dev-workflow): Require pinned-dependency compatibility verification on runtime/language major-version upgrades
  - Step 3 sub-step 1 (a) Scope & feasibility gains: when the plan proposes upgrading the base runtime or language major version, the reviewer must verify that all pinned dependencies (runtime and dev) explicitly cover the new version. Any dependency whose supported range does not include the new version must be flagged, and the plan must adopt the most conservative version all pinned dependencies safely support rather than leaving compatibility gaps for the user to catch at Step 4
- fix(dev-workflow): Add a Scope-drift guard around `check_commands` so auto-fix writes outside the task scope are surfaced instead of silently accepted
  - Step 7 sub-step 1 gains a "Scope-drift guard" bullet: before each command, record `git diff --name-only <base-commit>` as the task-scope snapshot. After the command, re-check the diff — any file newly appearing outside that snapshot was written by the command (auto-fix/write behavior sweeping unrelated drift). On detection, warn the user (listing both the in-scope files and the newly-appeared out-of-scope files), do **not** auto-revert / `git checkout` / delete the out-of-scope changes (leave the working tree as the command left it for user inspection), leave `Step 7: Check / Test` as `in_progress`, and wait for user direction. Positioned as the only allowed non-completing exit from the check_commands phase
  - The `## No-Stall Principle` enumeration adds **Step 7 scope-drift stop** as a new permissible pause point alongside the existing entries (Step 1.5 dialogues, Step 4 plan approval, Step 7 fail-stop, Step 7.5 persisting violations, Step 8 unresolved findings, Completion subtask PR URL prompt). Required by the section's own "update the enumeration and the definition together" invariant — a pause point introduced only in the Step 7 definition would have left the closed-list claim false

### dev-workflow v1.34.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.1

- fix(dev-workflow): Extend the `language` config scope to cover all user-facing prose the skill produces, not just Step 9.5
  - `language` now governs the Step 4 plan body (Overview / Decisions / Design / Test plan / Risks / Unknowns content) and the Step 2 difficulty-assessment log in addition to the Step 9.5 finding `Description` / `Suggested fix direction` paragraphs. Previously a Japanese user still received an English plan in Step 4 even though the rest of the conversation was Japanese
  - Plan section headings (`Overview` / `Decisions` / `Design` / `Test plan` / `Risks` / `Unknowns`), the Step 4 literal guidance line, and the Step 9.5 schema tokens / terminal summary / destination header remain English regardless of the setting so the template-contract and machine-checkable strings stay load-bearing
  - `## Configuration` entry rewritten to enumerate the three covered surfaces; Step 2 sub-step 7 and Step 4 sub-step 1 explicitly instruct writing the difficulty log and plan body prose in the resolved language
- fix(dev-workflow): Forbid non-template sections in the plan via a new Step 2 self-check bullet
  - `references/plan-format.md` § Step 2 self-check gains: "No section appears outside the enumerated template (Overview, Decisions, Design, Test plan, optionally Risks / Unknowns) — added 'meta' sections such as introductions, methodology notes, or recap blocks belong inside Design or should be dropped entirely". Header wording updated from "run this check on the Decisions section" to "run this check on the plan" to reflect the expanded scope; the trailing paragraph restates the template's required-headings list as the closed set of sections and the only structural property checked here
- fix(dev-workflow): Close Step 2 sub-step 8 against confirmation-seeking transition phrases
  - Step 2 sub-step 8 now explicitly forbids confirmation-seeking transition sentences such as "if this design looks good, I'll proceed to Step 3 (Plan Review)" or "shall I move on to Plan Review?" — they superficially read as natural conversation but constitute the same approval gate the step already prohibits and waste user attention on an unreviewed plan. The moment Step 2 ends, the workflow must advance to Step 3 without emitting any user-facing message about the plan or the transition
- fix(dev-workflow): Close Step 8 short-circuit rationalizations when re-running Step 7 / Step 7.5 after a fix
  - Step 8 iteration-loop sub-step 3 now mandates "Always re-run Step 7 and Step 7.5 — no exceptions" and explicitly disallows the common rationalizations: confidence in the fix, small diff size, modified paths that appear out of scope for the configured `check_commands` / `test_commands` (e.g. edits landing entirely under a local-skill directory or a docs-only path), or the re-run "would be a no-op". A genuine no-op outcome is the audit trail; skipping the re-run removes the trail. The only permissible skip remains the separate branch where no code was modified in the iteration

### dev-workflow v1.34.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.34.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Submit Step 9.5 repo-mode retrospectives via `gh api` instead of `gh issue create` to run with the minimum GitHub token permissions
  - `references/self-retrospective.md` § 4 Submit repo mode step 2 now invokes `gh api --method POST /repos/<feedback>/issues -f title=... -F body=@<staging-file>`. `gh api` only needs a token with `Issues: write` on the target repo, whereas `gh issue create` additionally requires broader read scopes for label/assignee metadata lookups — switching narrows the blast radius of a leaked token
  - `allowed-tools` in `SKILL.md` replaces `Bash(gh issue create *)` with `Bash(gh api --method POST /repos/*/issues *)` — pinned to the issue-creation endpoint so other `POST /repos/{o}/{r}/...` paths that carry higher blast radius (webhooks, deploy keys, `dispatches`, git refs/commits, repo transfer, releases) are NOT pre-approved. The two wildcards cover `<owner>/<repo>` in the URL and the trailing `-f title=... -F body=@<file>` flags. The § 5 "gh submission failure" retry hint and the README destination table / prerequisites entry are updated to the new invocation and call out the reduced token-scope requirement
- feat(dev-workflow): Delete the Step 9.5 repo-mode staging file after a successful submission, preserve it on failure
  - `references/self-retrospective.md` § 4 Submit repo mode gains sub-step 3: after the `gh api` POST returns exit 0, `rm` the staging file `.claude/plans/retrospective-<slug>.md`. On non-zero exit the file is left in place as a retry affordance — § 5 "gh submission failure" now surfaces the preserved path and a full `gh api` retry command
  - Path mode unchanged (the written file is the user-facing deliverable in that mode). The path-mode bullet now explicitly notes the no-delete behavior so the mode asymmetry is visible at a glance

## 2026-04-23

### dev-workflow v1.33.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.33.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add configurable output language for Step 9.5 finding prose
  - New top-level scalar config key `language` (e.g. `ja`, `en`), merged across the three settings layers like other scalars. Resolution: merged skill config → `~/.claude/settings.json` `language` field → default `ja`. `null` / empty string / non-string values fall through to the next step. Reading `~/.claude/settings.json` warns only on malformed JSON or an invalid `language` value; a missing file or missing key silently falls through to `ja`
  - Scope: only the `Description` / `Suggested fix direction` paragraphs of Step 9.5 findings honor the setting. Everything else — schema tokens (`### Finding <N>`, labels, enum values, `Findings: <N>`, `Status: ERROR`), terminal summary, destination header — stays English regardless of the setting
  - Step 9.5 threads the resolved language into `references/self-retrospective.md` §2.1 subagent prompt (new `Language` input + new "Language handling" instruction step). §3 sanitization applies to the localized prose regardless of language
  - §5 Machine-checkable rejection contract pinned to English so string/enum matching stays load-bearing. Added a **Contract note — do not relax for i18n** to prevent future editors from "fixing" §5 to accept translated tokens and silently break the main ↔ subagent contract

### dev-workflow v1.32.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.32.1

- fix(dev-workflow): Introduce No-Stall Principle so the workflow never pauses except at explicit user-gate points
  - New `## No-Stall Principle` section placed at the top of `## Execution Mode`. Enumerates the exhaustive list of permissible pause points (Step 1.5 decomposition dialogue, Step 1.5 Resume picker, Step 4 plan approval, Step 7 after 3 retries, Step 7.5 step 3.d persisting violations, Step 8 step 4 unresolved findings, Completion subtask PR URL prompt). At every other point the agent must treat skill results semantically and proceed automatically — no reliance on exact-phrase matching
  - Step 6 (Simplify): add an explicit completion clause — regardless of whether `Skill(simplify)` applied fixes or returned any other non-error result, mark the step `completed` and proceed to Step 7 automatically. Previously the step had a single sub-step (the skill invocation) with no guidance on handling a no-op return, so the workflow paused until the user said "continue"
  - Step 7.5 (Rules Compliance Review) step 2: replace the exact-phrase list ("No rule violations found", "All rules compliant", …) with a semantic-judgment instruction. The list was fragile because (i) `"All rules compliant"` was never emitted by the current rules-review implementation, and (ii) any future wording change in rules-review would silently break the match. Semantic judgment plus the No-Stall Principle is robust to output-format drift
  - Step 7.5 step 3.c (2nd-cycle re-run after violation fix): make the clean-2nd-cycle branch explicit — reuse the same semantic judgment as step 2 and proceed to Step 8 automatically. Previously only the "violations persist" branch was written, leaving the clean-re-run case without an explicit progress instruction
  - Step 9 (Update Rules): add a closing sub-step — after `Skill(extract-rules)` invocations return, mark the step `completed` and proceed automatically regardless of whether new rules were added or the skill reported nothing changed. Pre-emptive alignment with the No-Stall Principle so Step 9 stays consistent with Steps 6 and 7.5

### dev-workflow v1.32.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.32.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Structured plan format with a mandatory Decisions section to cut Step 4 user-review fatigue
  - New file `references/plan-format.md` — single source of truth for plan structure (Overview / Decisions / Design / Test plan / Risks), the (a)+(b) Decisions criterion, Subtask / Resume handling, the Step 2 self-check, the Step 3 (f) content-quality rubric, and the three literal Step 4 guidance lines
  - Step 2 Create Plan: sub-step 3 now instructs authors to follow the template in `references/plan-format.md`; new sub-step 5 **Plan presentation format self-check** runs the author's first-pass judgment on the (a)+(b) Decisions criterion, and subsequent sub-steps shift forward by one (the difficulty-based N adjustment and "do not present" now sit at sub-steps 7 and 8)
  - Step 3 Plan Review: adds review category **(f) Presentation & attention allocation (content quality)** — external re-check of the Decisions section's content (does each item genuinely pass (a)+(b), is there a judgment call buried in Design, are Overview/Design/Test plan/Decisions mutually consistent). Format compliance is not re-checked here — the Step 2 self-check is authoritative for structure, keeping the division of labor clean and preventing the "No actionable findings" short-circuit from bypassing format validation
  - Step 4 Finalize Plan: sub-step 1 leads with one of three literal English guidance lines (Decisions present / empty-Normal / empty-Resume) drawn verbatim from `references/plan-format.md`. The "Decisions present" variant tells the user where their judgment is actually needed; the empty variants turn "no decisions" into a strong skim-and-approve signal rather than a mistakenly-dropped section
  - README `## Plan format` section: user-facing summary of the template, the Decisions gate, and the recommended review procedure

### dev-workflow v1.31.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.31.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Address plan self-audit and code-review rubric gaps from retrospective-2026-04-22 (findings F1 / F2 code-review-side / F3 planning-side / F4 / F5 code-review-side; see Explicit defers below for what each finding did not cover in this release)
  - Step 2 Simplicity self-audit: added **Root-cause provenance check** — if the plan leans on a root-cause claim from an AI-authored prior-session artifact (inherited spec file, decomposition state file's AI-authored description), re-derive the root cause from the user's original ask before treating it as load-bearing. Previously the audit only flagged inherited design elements; root-cause claims embedded in those drafts could be adopted wholesale and later discovered to be wrong only after the implementation had been built on them
  - Step 2 Simplicity self-audit: added **Plan-level incrementality** as an author-side check. Previously incrementality was only asked at the reviewer level in Step 3.d; concrete plans that bundle independent work (e.g. a new retry primitive + unrelated control-flow refactor) could slip past the author and rely on the reviewer to catch them. Author-side check lets the split be proposed before peer review, reducing rework
  - Step 5 Implement: added a **Respect prior in-session edits** self-discipline — content the user explicitly removed earlier in this session (comments, guards, logs) must not reappear when applying plan steps, Step 6 simplify output, or Step 8 review fixes. Placed on the implementing agent (main) because reviewers/simplify subagents only see `git diff <base-commit>` and cannot detect a user-delete-then-agent-readd cycle whose net diff is zero. Previously the rubric treated "missing rationale" as something to add; that framing caused agents to silently resurrect comments and guards the user had already removed
  - Step 8 Code Review rubric: category **(b) Conventions & consistency** now explicitly treats **comment narration** (line-by-line paraphrase of the code) and **comment preamble** (restating information obvious from the surrounding function/file) as delete-candidates — the default action is removal, not asking the author to expand the rationale. The prior binary "does this comment explain why?" check was too permissive; long narration with one sentence of intent still passed
  - Step 8 Code Review rubric: category **(c) Simplicity & maintainability** now specifically enumerates the speculative-addition patterns that kept resurfacing across review iterations — **defensive hardening of already-safe paths, future-proofing for hypothetical double-calls, and double-coverage over paths already protected elsewhere** — with explicit "default to removal" framing. The prior generic "speculative features without explicit trigger" wording was read as a soft suggestion and routinely ignored in favor of "noting for later"
  - Step 7.5 literal-string match list: added `"No rule violations found"` to the e.g. list so the revised rules-review output (see below) is recognized as a compliant response

- Explicit defers (not implemented in this release):
  - **Finding 2 — Step 6 simplify-side application**: the retrospective's F2 fix direction named both code-review and simplify. This release strengthens Step 8 (code-review) only; the Step 6 simplify invocation is unchanged. Peer review during planning flagged that propagating the same rubric to Step 6 would duplicate responsibility without a distinct enforcement mechanism — `Skill(simplify)` already receives `custom_instructions` as its generic constraint channel. Users who want the speculative-addition / narration-preamble rubric at simplify time should surface it via `custom_instructions`. Revisit if future retrospectives show simplify-stage regressions
  - **Finding 3 — skill self-version staleness warning**: the retrospective's F3 also asked for a startup-time warning when the skill runs with a version older than what's available locally. Deferred as a separate task — dev-workflow itself has no version-read mechanism today, and "is a newer version available?" needs upstream-check infrastructure that's out of scope for a text-level rubric update
  - **Finding 5 — commit-message body scope**: the retrospective's F5 also asked that the same narration/preamble rubric apply to commit-message bodies. Commit authoring is not dev-workflow's responsibility (dev-workflow never stages, commits, or pushes); the Completion step delegates commit creation to the user (or to `hooks.on_complete` skills like `skill-review` / `work-complete`). The rubric should live in whichever skill owns commit authoring, not here

### extract-rules v1.13.0

- feat(extract-rules): Add post-generation Portability check to examples-format reference (retrospective-2026-04-22 finding F6)
  - `references/examples-format.md`: appended a new `## Portability check (post-generation)` section — after writing each example + description, re-read the pair and ask whether the description holds for every call site of the pattern, or leaks assumptions from the specific site it was mined from. Flags two common leaks: (i) **test-file origin** (unit-test samples that describe the pattern in test-isolation terms, which diverge from production semantics when the same pattern appears in production code) and (ii) **specific-site framing** (descriptions that reference local variables / fixture names that don't generalize). Fallback is to add a `test-only` qualifier to the rule title so downstream readers do not apply the rule outside its mined context
  - Applies to all modes (Full Extraction, Update, Restructure, Conversation, PR Review)
  - Also corrected the `## Common Generation Procedure` opening line to list `Restructure` alongside the other modes — the section already has a `### For Full Extraction / Restructure` subheading, but the parenthetical mode list at the top omitted Restructure

### rules-review v1.1.0

- feat(rules-review): Clarify hard-rule vs intent-rule coverage and align output string (retrospective-2026-04-22 finding F7)
  - `description`: appended "Best suited for hard rules (naming, imports, placement, explicit prohibitions); intent-style rules are checked on a best-effort basis." Previously the skill advertised a uniform "rule compliance check" which could be read as full coverage; in practice intent-style rules (comment taste, speculative-addition avoidance) are judgment calls that benefit from dev-workflow's Step 8 code-review in addition to this skill's structural scan
  - Agent prompt (Step 5): tells reviewers that rules may include **hard rules (binary compliance)** and **intent rules (judgment-based)**, to evaluate both, and that low-confidence intent-rule cases must be reported in the violation list with an explicit `low-confidence` marker — the exact "No rule violations found" response is reserved for confidently-clean cases. This preserves the aggregator's exact-string contract (Step 6) while routing borderline intent-rule cases out of the clean path, where the user would otherwise miss them
  - Output string change: `All rules compliant` → `No rule violations found` (single line, both the Step 6 aggregation branch and the Output Format template). Synced with dev-workflow Step 7.5's literal-string match list in the same release so the new string is recognized as compliant by the workflow

Note: `merge-rules` and `apply-rules` are **not** bumped. The output format of extract-rules is unchanged (the new Portability check is a pre-write guideline, not a format change), and rules-review's output string change has no downstream consumer beyond dev-workflow (updated in the same release).

## 2026-04-21

### dev-workflow v1.30.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.30.1

- fix(dev-workflow): Exclude Solution-Style root tsconfig from per-tsconfig type-check registration in `--init`
  - `references/init-mode.md`: when the root `tsconfig.json` has a non-empty `references` array (Solution-Style), the root itself is now excluded from `check_commands`. `tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` typically fails on Solution-Style roots because emit is disabled at the root; only the referenced leaf tsconfigs and other non-root tsconfigs that survive the name-based exclusion get registered. This closes a gap in v1.30.0's multi-tsconfig auto-registration where the generated command list could include a root entry that always errored
- docs(dev-workflow): Clarify Step 1.5 decomposition rationale is a chat message to the user
  - `references/task-decomposition.md`: the one-line rationale is now explicitly a **chat message to the user** — not a TodoWrite note or state-file field. This is the only visible audit trail for the "do NOT decompose" path, since the yes/adjust/no dialogue only fires on the "decompose" path. Without the chat line, negative decomposition decisions left no externally visible record

### extract-rules v1.12.1

- docs(extract-rules): Propagate `paths:` frontmatter from `<name>.md` to `<name>.local.md`, add `## Examples` link in project-specific templates
  - `SKILL.md` Step 6 output structure: `<name>.local.md` now carries the **same `paths:` frontmatter** as its `<name>.md` counterpart, so local project-specific patterns auto-load under the same scope as the portable Principles. Previously only `<name>.md` was documented as having `paths:`, which left `<name>.local.md` effectively unscoped despite being the more context-sensitive of the pair
  - Layer-specific and cross-layer rules about `paths:` now apply uniformly to both `.md` and `.local.md`
  - `## Project-specific patterns` template gains a trailing `## Examples` section pointing to the co-located `.examples.md` file (e.g. `./typescript.examples.md`), so reviewers can jump from a pattern note to runnable Good/Bad samples without guessing the filename

### apply-rules v2.0.2

- fix(apply-rules): Sync `paths:` frontmatter from `.md` to `.local.md` during Step 6b cleanup
  - `.local.md` files generated by extract-rules before v1.12.1 lack `paths:` frontmatter and are effectively unscoped. apply-rules Step 6b now retrofits the scope by copying (union + dedup) the sibling `.md`'s `paths:` onto any `.local.md` that survives the promoted-pattern cleanup. This aligns existing projects with the v1.12.1 contract without requiring a full extract-rules re-run
  - `.local.md` files deleted by the cleanup (emptied) are unaffected — no frontmatter sync is performed on deleted files

Note: `merge-rules` is **not** bumped. merge-rules output contains no `.local.md` (patterns are promoted to Principles), and input `.local.md` frontmatter is already parsed gracefully regardless of whether `paths:` is present.

## 2026-04-20

### dev-workflow v1.30.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.30.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Strengthen Simple classification, add external-library primary-source verification, close multi-tsconfig coverage gap, and open a runtime trigger for examples.md staleness review (retrospective-2026-04-20 findings F1/F2/F3/F4)
  - Step 2.6: Simple escalates to at least Moderate when the change touches an external library's configuration file or type-level API AND that library has had a recent major-version bump. The check is a quick `git diff <base-commit>` on the project's package manifest looking for major version changes. Similar qualitative risks (external config-DSL rewrites, etc.) follow the same rule. Mechanical check + qualitative trigger are combined so stale-config failures after a major upgrade cannot slip through the Simple path
  - Step 3 Plan Review: added a new category (e) **External library primary-source verification** (independent of category (a) so it gets its own reviewer checklist slot). When the plan touches an external library's API, configuration DSL, configuration file, enabled options, or type-level behavior — interpreted broadly so plugin activation and option tweaks count — reviewers must treat in-project references (`.examples.md`, `.local.md`, existing implementations) as secondary and require the plan to cite at least one primary source (installed type definitions, package source, or official reference docs). If the primary source cannot be consulted in the current environment (missing installed deps, no web access), the item is flagged in the plan as a stale-API concern instead of being trusted silently. Step 8 is not changed — the check is scoped to the planning gate to avoid noise at code review
  - Step 7: notes that TypeScript Project References / multi-tsconfig setups can leave changed files uncovered by `check_commands`. `--init` now auto-registers per-tsconfig `tsc -p <path> --noEmit` when 2+ tsconfigs or `references: [...]` are detected. The per-tsconfig form was chosen over `tsc -b --noEmit` because the latter is only supported on TypeScript ≥ 5.6; per-tsconfig `-p` is universally compatible and needs no version probing
  - Step 9: `--update` now additionally triggers when a dependency's major-version bump is detected via `git diff <base-commit>` on the package manifest (same signal as Step 2.6). This opens the runtime path for finding F3 — without this trigger the extract-rules Update Mode operational note was documented but never read in practice, because `--update` only ran on "significant structural/pattern changes"
  - Step 9.5: Simple hard-skip is now overridable by an explicit user request **within the same session** (e.g. "run the retrospective for this run anyway"). The manual re-run runs the `references/self-retrospective.md` procedure from §1 without updating TodoWrite (the Step 9.5 row stays `completed`) and prompts the user to re-verify the session jsonl selection at §1.4. Cross-session re-runs are not supported — once the workflow session has ended, the Step 2.6 difficulty assessment cannot be recovered. `references/self-retrospective.md`:7 was rewritten to define both the normal read path and the manual-re-run read path consistently
  - README.md sync: the Simple row now carries the major-bump exception as a footnote, and the Hard-skip-on-Simple section is retitled "overridable on explicit request" with invocation example
  - Out of scope (deferred): a lightweight coverage-check sub-step that warns when a changed file is not covered by any `check_command`. Out of scope for this release — the `--init` improvement closes the most common TypeScript instance, and a generic coverage-check step needs more design

### extract-rules v1.12.0

- docs(extract-rules): Operational note for post-major-version updates (retrospective-2026-04-20 finding F3)
  - Update Mode now opens with an operational note: after a dependency's major-version bump, run `--update` so the staleness check (Step U3) can flag removed symbols. The note also makes explicit that the current Step U3 check only inspects inline `` `symbol` `` patterns in `## Project-specific patterns` sections (`.local.md`) — code samples inside `.examples.md` are **not** auto-scanned. Manual review of `.examples.md` is required after a major bump; otherwise stale configuration samples there can silently propagate into future plans via reviewers treating project examples as authoritative
  - `--restructure` is not recommended for post-major-bump sync (it does not run a staleness check)
  - Out of scope: Restructure / Conversation / PR-Review mode ripple of the staleness check, fenced-code-block parser for `.examples.md`. Not addressed in this release

Note: `apply-rules` and `merge-rules` are **not** bumped. The `extract-rules` output format is unchanged by this release, and neither SKILL.md references dev-workflow / extract-rules content directly, so their behavior is unaffected.

## 2026-04-18

### dev-workflow v1.29.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.29.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add Step 9.5 Self-Retrospective (Phase 1 — bundle-skill improvement signal)
  - New optional config key `self_retrospective.feedback` (string). When set, a new Step 9.5 runs between Step 9 (Update Rules) and Step 10 (Completion Hooks), scanning the current conversation for improvement signals about the bundled skills (`dev-workflow`, `ask-peer`, `extract-rules`, `rules-review`), sanitizing them, and submitting to a user-configured destination
  - Destination is auto-detected from the `feedback` string: `owner/repo` pattern → GitHub issue via `gh issue create`; paths starting with `/`, `~/`, `./`, `../` → a markdown file under that directory; any other value → warn and skip
  - Raw conversation (jsonl) stays in-session — only abstracted, project-agnostic text leaves. Explicit sanitization rules cover absolute paths, project/repo/product/user names, project-specific code identifiers, and dates/IDs/URLs. User preview + approve/edit/skip loop is always shown before submission
  - Skipped entirely when `self_retrospective.feedback` is unset or invalid (Step 9.5 not registered in TodoWrite). Also hard-skipped when Step 2 assesses the task as Simple difficulty (typo fix, config tweak), regardless of config — Simple tasks rarely exercise the bundled skills enough to produce meaningful signal
  - Repo-mode runs an early `gh auth status` check at Step 1 as a warning only, so the user is alerted up front that Step 9.5 will abort later; Step 9.5 re-checks and aborts with an actionable message as a backstop
  - Issue title is fixed as `[auto-retrospective] dev-workflow-bundle: <N> findings (<YYYY-MM-DD>)` so downstream automation can filter reliably; no default label
  - Full procedure (pre-flight, extraction, sanitization, submission, error handling) lives in `references/self-retrospective.md` (mirrors the Step 1.5 → `task-decomposition.md` deep-reference pattern)
  - Phase 2 (local skill-ification candidates from conversation scan, with create/edit/skip approval UX that writes directly under `.claude/skills/`) is intentionally deferred to a follow-up release (planned 1.30.0). Phase 1 ships the retrospective infrastructure; Phase 2 adds the higher-risk file-creation flow with name validation, allowed-tools constraints, and SKILL.md syntax validation

### dev-workflow v1.28.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.28.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Refine Step 1.5 decomposition heuristic toward independently-verifiable units
  - `references/task-decomposition.md` section B step 1 criteria reordered and rewritten. "The task splits into 2+ units where each unit has a distinct verification path" is now the strongest decompose signal, elevated above cross-module / and-list / staged-refactor heuristics
  - When decomposition signals are mixed, the workflow now biases toward proposing decomposition (the yes/adjust/no dialogue is cheap, smaller shippable PRs cut review load). "Feature looks singular" is no longer sufficient grounds on its own
  - Do NOT decompose criteria reframed around single verification path, atomicity-breaking splits, and a new guardrail against over-splitting (subtasks so small that per-PR overhead exceeds the benefit)
  - Rationale log now names the **primary signal** that drove the decision (e.g. `decompose: 2 distinct verification paths — admin CRUD + chat insertion`), so decomposition bias can be audited after the fact
  - Section B step 3.c decomposition-proposal dialogue now lists each subtask with its `verification_hint` (and `depends_on`), so the user can judge the breakdown at a glance before answering yes/adjust/no
  - Clarified decompose vs. veto precedence: atomicity / over-split vetoes and the single-verification-path case override non-primary positive signals (and-list, cross-layer, staged refactor). Only the primary signal — genuinely distinct verification paths — overrides these vetoes. Resolves the ambiguity where a light "X and Y" request could decompose despite PR overhead outweighing benefit
  - Clarified that `verification_hint` shown in the Step 1.5 proposal is advisory context for the split decision, not a user-approved completion contract — consistent with Step 2's existing treatment of `verification_hint` as AI-authored draft within otherwise-approved state files, so Step 2 can still refine hints without violating the yes the user gave in Step 1.5
  - Addresses a failure mode where features with 2 distinct verification units (e.g. admin CRUD + chat insertion) were classified as "feature contained in one module" and shipped as a single oversized PR, requiring post-hoc splitting
  - README.md "Decomposition judgment" section synced with the new criteria

### dev-workflow v1.27.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.27.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add simplicity-first audit to Step 2 / Plan Review / Code Review
  - Step 2 gains a new `Simplicity self-audit` sub-step. Right after drafting the plan, each element must be traceable to an explicit user requirement, a known bug/constraint, or a documented `.claude/rules/` rule; elements without such a trigger must be dropped or annotated with an explicit rationale
  - Inherited spec files under `.claude/plans/*.md` are treated as prior-session drafts, not confirmed requirements. Task-decomposition state files are the exception: user-approved subtask boundaries, order, `depends_on`, and purposes are honored as-is, while AI-authored descriptions within each subtask remain draft
  - Step 3 category (a) Scope & feasibility is reframed to verify the author's self-audit, so the reviewer focuses on elements with weak or missing rationale rather than re-running the same traceability check
  - Step 8 category (c) Simplicity & maintainability now explicitly flags speculative features without an explicit trigger, catching scope creep that slipped past earlier gates
  - Addresses a failure mode where prior-session plan files were treated as confirmed requirements and carried forward unvetted elaboration into implementation

## 2026-04-13

### dev-workflow v1.26.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.26.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add `Incrementality` category to Step 3 Plan Review
  - Reviewer is now asked whether the plan can be split into smaller, independently verifiable units (hotfix vs refactor, behavior change vs structural change)
  - Catches cases where a task-level "single concern" still bundles independent work at the plan level, where Step 1.5 decomposition correctly passed
  - Regression attribution concerns ("which change caused this?") are called out as a strong splittability signal

## 2026-04-11

### dev-workflow v1.25.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.25.1

- fix(dev-workflow): Explicitly instruct autonomous judgment on review findings
  - Step 3 (Plan Review) and Step 8 (Code Review) now explicitly state "autonomously ... do not ask the user for judgment on individual review findings"
  - Addresses issue where the model deferred to the user on every review finding instead of autonomously applying fixes or rejecting inapplicable points
  - Final fallback to user (Step 3.4 / Step 8.4 for unresolved points after all iterations) remains unchanged

## 2026-04-10

### dev-workflow v1.25.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.25.0

- refactor(dev-workflow): Remove completion hooks prompt from `--init`
  - `--init` no longer asks about hooks — hooks are left unconfigured by default
  - Users can still configure `hooks.on_complete` manually in settings files (execution mode Step 10 unchanged)

### dev-workflow v1.24.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.24.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add 3-layer configuration with type-aware merge
  - New project shared settings file: `.claude/dev-workflow.md` (git tracked, team-shared)
  - Settings are merged across three layers: user global (`~/.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`) → project shared (`.claude/dev-workflow.md`) → personal override (`.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`)
  - Merge strategy: scalar keys are replaced by higher layer; list keys (`check_commands`) are appended and deduplicated; `hooks` is deep-merged (`on_complete` list is appended). `null`/empty explicitly clears the key
  - `--init` now saves to `.claude/dev-workflow.md` (project shared) instead of `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`
  - Existing `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md` continues to work as the highest-priority personal override layer — no migration needed
  - Personal overrides (`.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`) are created manually with only the keys to override

### dev-workflow v1.23.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.23.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add `task_decomposition` setting to disable auto-decomposition in Normal sub-mode
  - Default `true` — existing behavior unchanged
  - Set to `false` to skip Step 1.5's auto-decomposition check entirely — Normal sub-mode requests (`/dev-workflow <task>`) are treated as single tasks. Step 1.5 is omitted from TodoWrite in this mode
  - `--resume <state-file>` is unaffected — existing state files can still be resumed explicitly
  - Non-boolean values fall back to `true` with a warning
- docs(dev-workflow): Refactor SKILL.md for skill-creator best practices
  - Step 1.5 Task Decomposition detail extracted to `references/task-decomposition.md` — SKILL.md drops from 306 to 254 lines (~17% reduction), and simple single-concern runs no longer load state-file semantics they don't need (progressive disclosure)
  - Step 3 / Step 8 `MUST continue re-review` reframed with the *why* (plan modifications often introduce fresh ripple effects; code fixes routinely introduce new bugs) so the instruction persuades instead of insisting
  - No runtime behavior change — all semantics preserved, just documented differently

## 2026-04-09

### dev-workflow v1.22.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.22.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add task decomposition for splitting large tasks into PR-sized subtasks
  - New **Step 1.5: Task Decomposition** runs between Step 1 (Load Settings) and Step 2 (Create Plan)
  - In Normal sub-mode, the workflow lightweightly judges whether the request should be split and proposes a decomposition to the user for approval. Simple, single-concern tasks pass through unchanged
  - Approved decompositions are persisted to `.claude/plans/dev-workflow.<slug>.md` — one state file per parent task, so multiple parent tasks can proceed in parallel
  - Each subtask runs through the existing Step 2–10 flow as an independent PR-sized unit
  - New `--resume <state-file>` flag picks up the next runnable subtask in a fresh session. Accepts full path, filename, or bare slug
  - On subtask completion, the workflow instructs the user to commit + open a PR before resuming the next subtask. The workflow itself never stages, commits, or pushes
  - Parent-task progress is surfaced as a TodoWrite top-level row (`Parent task: N/TOTAL subtasks done — <slug>`)
  - Edge cases handled: YAML parse errors on state files, `depends_on` cycles, missing `--resume` targets, and leftover `in_progress` subtasks from interrupted sessions
  - Step 1.5 is intentionally separate from Plan Mode (which is still reserved for Step 2) so the decomposition proposal is a plain yes/no dialogue

## 2026-04-07

### dev-workflow v1.21.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.21.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add automatic review iteration adjustment based on task difficulty
  - Assesses task difficulty (Simple/Moderate/Complex) after plan creation in Step 2
  - Reduces review iteration count (N) for simpler tasks — configured value acts as ceiling, not target
  - Simple tasks (typo fix, config tweak): N=1, Moderate (single-module multi-file): N=min(2,N), Complex: keep N
  - Explicit `-i N` / `--iterations N` CLI flag skips difficulty assessment (user override)
  - Excess TodoWrite iteration items (Step 3-x, Step 8-x) marked as completed when N is reduced

### All plugins (patch version bump)

- fix: Isolate plugin source directories to prevent duplicate skill registration
  - Each plugin now has its own `plugins/<name>/` source directory with symlinks to `skills/`
  - Previously all plugins shared `source: "./"`, causing Claude Code to auto-discover all skills for every plugin
  - Workaround for [anthropics/claude-code#13344](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13344)
- docs: Update CLAUDE.md to reflect new plugin structure and skill addition flow

## 2026-04-06

### dev-workflow v1.20.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.20.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add `custom_instructions` configuration for injecting user-defined development instructions
  - Free-form string applied to planning (Step 2), plan review (Step 3), implementation (Step 5), simplify (Step 6), and code review (Step 8)
  - Configured via `dev-workflow.local.md` YAML frontmatter
  - `.claude/rules/` and explicit user requests take precedence over `custom_instructions`

### dev-workflow v1.19.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.19.0

- feat(dev-workflow): Add hooks configuration for executing skills/commands at workflow timing points
  - `hooks.on_complete`: runs after Step 9 (Update Rules), before completion report
  - Entry format: `Skill(<name>)` for skill invocation, or shell command string
  - Non-blocking: hook failures are reported as warnings in completion summary
  - Configured via `dev-workflow.local.md` YAML frontmatter
- feat(dev-workflow): Add Step 10 (Completion Hooks) to workflow execution
- feat(dev-workflow --init): Add hooks configuration step to project setup flow

## 2026-04-04

### merge-rules v2.0.0 / apply-rules v2.0.0 / extract-rules v1.11.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.3

**Breaking change**: Promoted patterns are now converted to Principles format and integrated into `## Principles`. The `## Project-specific patterns` section is no longer produced by merge-rules. Existing merge-rules output with `## Project-specific patterns` must be regenerated by re-running merge-rules.

- feat(merge-rules): Promote .local.md patterns to Principles format (`Description (signature)`) instead of separate `## Project-specific patterns` section
- feat(merge-rules): Add deduplication against existing Principles to prevent self-amplification from previously promoted patterns in `.local.md`
- feat(merge-rules): Promoted pattern examples are included under `## Principles Examples` (no more `## Project-specific Examples` in output)
- feat(merge-rules): Design note clarifying promoted Principles are permanent org-level rules
- feat(apply-rules): Clean up promoted patterns from `.local.md` files (cross-format duplicate removal)
- feat(apply-rules): Remove corresponding `## Project-specific Examples` entries for cleaned-up patterns
- feat(apply-rules): Delete `.local.md` files that become empty after cleanup
- remove(apply-rules): Remove promoted→`.local.md` routing (promoted patterns are now regular Principles)
- feat(extract-rules): Add cross-format duplicate check in Update mode (Step U4) and Conversation mode to prevent re-adding patterns already promoted to Principles
- refactor: Simplify skill descriptions for merge-rules, apply-rules, and extract-rules to reduce context overhead

### extract-rules v1.10.1 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.2 (earlier today)

- feat: Remove default size limits from `extract_session_messages.mjs` — all messages included by default
  - `--max-chars` and `--max-per-message` are now optional (default: no limit)
  - Previously defaulted to 100K chars / 2000 chars per message

## 2026-04-03

### extract-rules v1.10.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.1

- feat: `--from-conversation` mode reads full session history from `.jsonl` files on disk
  - No longer limited to context window — captures all messages including those lost to compaction
  - Session file located via encoded project path under `~/.claude/projects/`
  - Supports `<session-id>` argument to target a specific session (default: latest by mtime)
- feat: Delegate heavy processing to subagent to keep main context clean
  - Main agent handles settings + session file resolution (C1-C2)
  - Subagent handles jsonl parsing, analysis, rule extraction, and file writing (C3-C5)
  - Subagent instructions moved to `references/conversation-mode.md` (progressive disclosure)
- feat: Bundle Node.js script `scripts/extract_session_messages.mjs` for jsonl parsing
  - Filters user/assistant text messages, skips tool_use/thinking blocks
  - Recovers `AskUserQuestion` responses via interactive tool ID whitelist
  - Latest-first processing with configurable size limits (100K chars default)
  - Input validation, malformed JSON line diagnostics
- refactor: Replace `Bash(python3 *)` with `Bash(node *)` in allowed-tools (node is guaranteed by Claude Code)
- fix: Update `references/pr-review-mode.md` Step C4 → C5 reference

### dev-workflow v1.18.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.18.0

- feat: Improve init-mode run-tests generation for autonomous test execution
  - Add Docker daemon readiness check as prerequisite when docker-compose is detected (daemon → services, two-step)
  - Detect existing run-tests skills lacking Docker daemon check and offer regeneration
  - Support `.yaml` extension variants for docker-compose detection
  - Generalize run-tests template: category-based prerequisites, technology-agnostic allowed-tools
  - Add async service retry rule in Process section (re-check with retries for up to 30 seconds)
  - Align pseudo-execute flow with async retry rule

## 2026-04-02

### rules-review v1.0.0

- feat: New skill for `.claude/rules/` compliance checking
  - Match rule files to changed files via `paths:` frontmatter globs
  - Group rules by category (project, languages, frameworks, integrations, custom)
  - Parallel review via sub-agents per group
  - Standalone usage: `/rules-review --base-commit <sha>`

### dev-workflow v1.17.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.17.0

- feat: Add Step 7.5 (Rules Compliance Review) as dedicated rules enforcement step
  - Runs `Skill(rules-review)` between Check/Test (Step 7) and Code Review (Step 8)
  - 2-cycle max: fix violations → re-verify → escalate to user if unresolved
  - Step 8 re-run after code modifications includes Step 7.5
  - Step 8 retains lightweight rules check as safety net
- feat: Bundle `rules-review` skill with `dev-workflow-bundle` plugin

## 2026-04-01

### dev-workflow v1.16.0

- feat: Strengthen rules compliance checking and test coverage verification
  - Step 2: Require specific test files (existing to update or new to create) in test plan, not just abstract descriptions
  - Step 3: Plan reviewer verifies specific test files are identified and existing related tests are covered for update; read all files under `.claude/rules/`
  - Step 8: Reviewer must read all files under `.claude/rules/` and verify compliance against the diff, citing rule file path and violated rule text
  - Step 8: Verify planned test files from Step 2 are present in the diff

### dev-workflow v1.15.1

- fix: Ensure re-review after modifications in Plan Review (Step 3) and Code Review (Step 8)
  - If plan/code was modified based on review feedback, MUST continue to next iteration for re-review
  - If all points were rejected (no modifications), remaining iterations can be skipped
  - Step 8: Consolidate "Re-run Step 7" and "re-review required" under single "code was modified" branch

### dev-workflow v1.15.0

- fix: Strengthen plan approval flow to prevent premature user approval before plan review
  - Step 2: Explicitly forbid presenting plan or asking for approval/confirmation (bold + caps emphasis)
  - Step 3: Add internal review declaration — do not present plan to user during review iterations
  - Step 4: Add `(USER APPROVAL GATE)` to heading, mark as first time user sees the plan
  - Step 4: Add re-review condition — return to Step 3 with new iteration item if user requests material scope/approach changes
  - Step 4: Require explicit user acceptance before proceeding

### apply-rules v1.1.0

- feat: Add `AskUserQuestion` to `allowed-tools` for explicit user confirmation at decision points
  - Step 4 (Integration proposals): batched list with `all / none / number` selection
  - Step 5.5 (File name normalization): confirm renames before applying
  - Step 6 (Principle conflicts): collect all conflicts, present together with `1a, 2c` format
  - Step 7 (Non-conforming files): migration plan as single list, `project.*` excluded from "all"
- feat: Update Conflict Handling table to reflect all `AskUserQuestion` usage points

## 2026-03-31

### apply-rules v1.0.0

- feat: New skill to apply organization-wide rules (merge-rules output) to any project
  - Source specification via GitHub URL or local path (direct path to rules directory)
  - Auto-detect project tech stack (languages, frameworks, integrations) to filter relevant rules
  - Intelligent merge: `.md` (Principles) merged, `.local.md` preserved, promoted patterns routed to `.local.md`
  - Integration proposal: suggest unused but related integration rules for user approval
  - Structure conformance check: migrate non-conforming rule files with user confirmation
  - Fetch from GitHub via `gh api` (no git clone authentication issues)
  - Dry-run mode for previewing changes

## 2026-03-30

### dev-workflow v1.14.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.14.0

- fix: Embed check_commands/test_commands values in TodoWrite Step 7 description to prevent context loss
  - Step 7 registered as `Step 7: Check / Test [check: {check_commands} | test: {test_commands}]`
  - Settings values stay visible through TodoWrite progress checks, reducing risk of AI forgetting commands mid-workflow

### dev-workflow v1.13.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.13.0

- feat: Add test prerequisites check & setup to `run-tests` skill template
  - Auto-detect prerequisites from project files (docker-compose.yml, database.yml, .env.example, bin/setup)
  - Prerequisites section added to generated `run-tests` only when detected
  - Check prerequisites → setup if needed → spawn subagent for test execution; setup failure reports EXECUTION_ERROR with remediation
  - `allowed-tools` in generated skill dynamically includes prerequisite commands
- fix: Use pseudo-execution for `--init` verification step (resolves unregistered skill issue in same session)
  - Read generated SKILL.md and execute test commands directly instead of calling `Skill(run-tests)`
  - Prerequisites checks also run during pseudo-execution
- docs: Add session note — skills generated by `--init` are recognized from the next session onward

### dev-workflow v1.12.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.12.0

- feat: Subagent-based test execution to reduce main context consumption
  - `--init` generates canonical `run-tests` skill with Agent-based subagent execution
  - All test execution goes through `Skill(run-tests)` — no more direct shell commands or arbitrary skill names
  - Subagent returns structured summary (SUCCESS / TEST_FAILED / EXECUTION_ERROR) instead of raw test output
  - Includes stack trace excerpts and code locations for failures — enough to fix without re-running
  - Scope decision delegated to `run-tests` skill via `--base-commit <sha>` argument
  - Existing `run-tests` in current format is reused; outdated format is automatically regenerated (test commands are preserved)
- docs: Add `run-tests` SKILL.md template to `references/init-mode.md`

### dev-workflow v1.11.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.11.0

- feat: Add `review_iterations` default value (3) to `--init` generated config file
- feat: Add verification step after `--init` config creation
  - Run check_commands and test_commands to verify they work
  - `Skill()` entries: select a test file and invoke the skill, or run minimum test scope
  - Report pass/fail summary; failures suggest fixes but do not block

## 2026-03-28

### dev-workflow v1.10.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.10.0

- feat: Enhance `--init` test_commands detection with test skill auto-detection and generation
  - Detect existing test skills in `.claude/skills/` (e.g., `test-file`, `run-tests`) and propose `Skill(<name>)`
  - Auto-generate `run-tests` skill when 3+ distinct test scopes detected (with overwrite protection)
  - Fall back to direct commands for 1-2 test scopes, or project-type standard commands
- refactor: Extract Init Mode instructions to `references/init-mode.md` for progressive disclosure

### dev-workflow v1.9.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.9.0

- feat: Make review iteration count configurable (default: 3, positive integer)
  - Add `review_iterations` setting to `dev-workflow.local.md` configuration
  - Add `-i N` / `--iterations N` command option for per-invocation override
  - Priority: `-i` / `--iterations` option > config `review_iterations` > default `3`
  - Step 1: Dynamically generate N iteration sub-items for TodoWrite registration
  - Steps 3/8: Process N pending iteration items instead of hardcoded 3

### dev-workflow v1.8.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.8.0

- feat: Improve plan approval flow — reviewer reviews the plan before user approval
  - Step 2: Add instruction to proceed directly to Step 3 without asking user for approval
  - Step 4: Add explicit user approval flow (present → collaborate → accept → ExitPlanMode)
  - Step 3: Carry unresolved review points forward to Step 4 instead of asking user mid-review

### peer v2.2.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.7.1

- feat: Add autonomous parallel review — when a review request contains multiple independent categories, ask-peer spawns one subagent per category in parallel and merges results

## 2026-03-27

### dev-workflow v1.7.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.7.0

- feat: Add test review perspectives to plan creation, plan review, and code review
  - Step 2: Require test plan in implementation plan (what to test, test types, scope — or why no tests are needed)
  - Step 3: Change review category from "test strategy" to "test plan adequacy" for explicit presence/scope check
  - Step 8: Add "missing or insufficient tests for changes" to Correctness & edge cases category

### dev-workflow v1.6.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.6.0

- feat: Pre-register review iterations in Step 1 TodoWrite checklist as sub-items (Step 3-1/3-2/3-3, Step 8-1/8-2/8-3)
  - Iterations visible from workflow start, making skipping structurally harder
  - Step 3/8 rewritten as "process each pending iteration item" instead of loop description
  - Eliminates natural-language loop that AI tends to short-circuit after 1 pass

  - Prevents short-circuiting reviews after a single iteration

### dev-workflow v1.4.0 / dev-workflow-bundle v1.4.0

- feat: Strengthen code review (Step 8) enforcement to prevent skipping
  - Add TodoWrite-based workflow phase tracking in Step 1 (all phases registered upfront, phase items must remain)
  - Add GATE check between Step 7 and Step 8 (verify prior steps completed)
  - Add `MANDATORY, DO NOT SKIP` marker to Step 8 header
  - Structure review request into 3 categories (Correctness, Conventions, Simplicity)
  - Add iteration status tracking via TodoWrite in Step 8
- fix: Change review loop condition from "code modified" to "actionable feedback remains"
