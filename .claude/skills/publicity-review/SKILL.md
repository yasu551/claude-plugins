# Publicity Review

The convergence signal is the executor itself returning `findings: []` AND `suggested_edits: []` on a pass verdict — that is, the subagent declares nothing more is left to flag. This skill loops until that signal, max iterations is reached, a divergence is detected, or a safety rail trips.

The detection scope is narrow on purpose: secrets, user-specific absolute paths (e.g. `/Users/<name>/...`), internal-only URLs / hostnames, personal identifiers, and obvious proprietary internal info. It is **not** a generic linter — license, brand, or stylistic content is out of scope.

Designed to be called from non-interactive routines such as `dev-workflow-triage` or `dev-workflow`'s `hooks.on_complete`. It never prompts the user; it either returns a structured summary or terminates early with a machine-readable reason code.

## Invocation contract

The caller passes these fields in natural language (the skill extracts them from the invocation text):

- `Base ref` *(optional, default `HEAD`)* — git ref to diff against
- `Max iterations` *(optional, default `2`)* — upper bound on the refinement loop

The caller must **not** stage changes while this skill is running. The skill reads the working tree vs `Base ref`; staged content would mix into the diff and corrupt the verdict.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Extract context (main thread)

1. Parse the two fields from the invocation text.
2. Run `git diff <Base ref>`. This captures working-tree-vs-base; no staging is assumed.
3. If the diff is empty, return early:
   ```json
   {"status": "skipped", "iterations_used": 0, "applied_edits_count": 0, "findings_count": 0, "remaining_findings": [], "warnings_findings": [], "reverted_paths": [], "reason": "empty diff"}
   ```
4. Compute `affected_files` — the set of file paths in the diff. Hold this set in main-thread context as the scope-check baseline for Step 2 (c).

There is no explicit pre-flight diff-size cap — sibling review skills (`ask-peer`, `verify-diff`, `skill-review`, `rules-review`) all dispatch without one, and `publicity-review`'s detection task (local pattern matching for secret / path / URL signatures) is less context-sensitive than cross-file semantic review. If the dispatch is too large for the subagent runtime, the `Agent` tool returns an error / timeout / empty response, which falls through to `## Dispatch failure` (`status=skipped, reason="dispatch error"`). That path captures the only real-world failure mode an absolute byte cap was protecting against.

### Step 2 — Iteration loop (i = 1 .. Max iterations)

**Pre-register iteration TodoWrite items** — before entering the loop, create `iteration 1`, ..., `iteration <Max iterations>` items. Mark `in_progress` before each dispatch, `completed` after parse + apply (a `converged` verdict marks `completed` immediately after parsing). On early convergence or safety-rail exit, mark remaining items `completed` with note appended to the item's `content` field as `— skipped: <reason>`.

#### (a) Dispatch reviewer Agent

On iter 1, `Read` the full current contents of each `affected_files` entry. On `i ≥ 2`, only re-`Read` the subset of `affected_files` whose path appeared in a successfully-applied `suggested_edits` entry during iter `i-1` (untouched files keep their iter-1 snapshot — re-reading them is wasted work and balloons main-thread context). On `i ≥ 2`, also re-run `git diff <Base ref>` so the diff reflects edits that landed in prior iterations.

Invoke the `Agent` tool to dispatch a fresh reviewer. Assemble the dispatch prompt from the four sections below, each framed with a clear `--- LABEL ---` fence (same convention as `verify-diff` § Step 3 (a) Dispatch bias-free executor and `skill-review` § Step 3 (a) Dispatch reviewer Agent) so the reviewer can parse each payload unambiguously:

- `--- DIFF ---`: the unified diff (current `git diff <Base ref>` output)
- `--- AFFECTED FILES ---`: each `affected_files` entry's path + full current contents (one block per file, separated by `### <path>` sub-headings)
- `--- REVIEWER PROMPT ---`: the reviewer prompt and detection rules below (verbatim)
- `--- RESPONSE FORMAT ---`: the response format and JSON schema below (verbatim)

**Reviewer prompt (include verbatim in the dispatch):**

> You are a fresh reviewer of an uncommitted git diff for a **public open-source repository**. Your only job is to flag content in the diff's `+` lines (newly added content) that should not be published publicly.
>
> Detection categories (`category` enum):
>
> - `secret`: API keys, OAuth tokens, bearer tokens, passwords, private keys (`-----BEGIN .*PRIVATE KEY-----` blocks), `.env` literal values, AWS / GCP / Azure credentials, JWT secrets. Recognizable prefixes include `sk-`, `ghp_`, `gho_`, `AKIA`, `xox[bp]-`, `eyJ` (JWT-like). Any value matching one of these formats is treated as a credential for severity purposes — `severity: high` is load-bearing for the Step 3 secret-bypass rule and applies regardless of whether the value looks like a placeholder, dummy, or canonical docs example. Use `confidence` to express how likely the value is to be functionally exploitable: `high` for real-looking values (random-looking entropy); `medium` for plausible fixtures (looks real but variable name suggests test); `low` for obvious placeholders (sequential digits like `12345-67890`, alphabet runs like `abcdef`, or known canonical docs placeholders — AWS / GCP / Azure documentation values whose tail spells out `EXAMPLE` or `PLACEHOLDER`).
> - `user-specific-path`: absolute paths into a user's home directory like `/Users/<name>/...`, `/home/<name>/...`, or hardcoded references to a single contributor's local checkout. Default `severity: medium` (leaks contributor identity / breaks portability, but not exploitable as a credential). Exception — see exclusions below.
> - `internal-url`: hostnames or URLs that are clearly internal, such as `*.internal`, `*.corp`, `*.local`, internal Slack workspace URLs (`<workspace>.slack.com` references that name a private workspace), private Notion / Confluence pages.
> - `personal-identifier`: real names, personal email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses of individuals — beyond what would normally appear in a git commit author signature (which is by definition already public).
> - `proprietary-info`: code or text labeled "internal only", "confidential", "do not distribute"; references to internal architecture documents that are not public.
> - `other`: catch-all for content that clearly should not be public but does not fit the categories above.
>
> Exclusions (do **not** flag these):
>
> - `~/.claude/...` — Claude Code's standard config root, not a user-specific path. Applies to mentions in prose, comments, and code alike (e.g. README sentences like ``Edit `~/.claude/settings.json` ``).
> - Files referenced via `.gitignore` — those files are already excluded from the repo.
> - Lines that appear in the diff context (lines without a leading `+`) — only judge `+` lines (newly added content).
> - `<word>/<word>` patterns (e.g. `anthropics/claude-code`) and full URLs to public hosts (`github.com`, `npmjs.com`, `pypi.org`, `crates.io`, etc.) referencing a public repo / package: do not flag if the reference points to a verifiable public resource. If you cannot verify and have residual doubt, emit a single low-stakes finding at `severity: low, confidence: low`. Applies to README / markdown prose, code comments, and config alike. (Public-host URLs are explicitly **not** `internal-url` — that category targets `*.internal` / `*.corp` / `*.local` / private SaaS workspaces only.)
>
> For each finding, also assign:
>
> - `severity` ∈ `high|medium|low`: how dangerous is this if published?
> - `confidence` ∈ `high|medium|low`: how certain are you that this is actually a leak (vs. a false positive)?
> - `snippet`: a short excerpt from the offending line — keep enough surrounding tokens to identify the variable / call site (e.g. `openai.api_key = "<REDACTED>"` rather than a bare `"<REDACTED>"`), but no more than the offending line itself. **For `category: secret` findings, replace the actual credential value with the literal string `<REDACTED>`** so the verdict block does not itself leak the secret.
> - `rationale`: a short reason in 1–2 phrases.
>
> When a finding is **mechanically fixable** (the replacement is unambiguous and does not require project context to decide), additionally emit a `suggested_edits` entry. Restrict `suggested_edits` emission to:
>
> - `category: secret`: replace the credential value with a syntactically inert placeholder. The default everywhere is the **quoted-string form** `"<REDACTED — replace with env var>"` (or single-quoted equivalent in the file's idiom). Only use a comment-form placeholder (`# <REDACTED>` for Python / shell, `// <REDACTED>` for JS / TS, `<!-- <REDACTED> -->` for HTML / markdown) when the offending line is itself a comment or standalone declaration that can be safely commented out — never to replace the value half of an assignment, which would leave the variable unset and change runtime behavior. Do **not** rewrite to a form that requires a new import or symbol the file doesn't already have (e.g. `os.environ[...]` requires `import os`, which a single Edit can't add cleanly — fall back to the quoted-string form).
> - `category: user-specific-path`: replace `/Users/<name>/...` (or `/home/<name>/...`) with `~/<rest-of-path>` — substitute only the user-home prefix. Do **not** rewrite to a project-relative path; that requires project context the reviewer doesn't have. If `<rest-of-path>` itself looks user-specific (e.g. `Sources/private-checkout/...`), record the finding without a `suggested_edits` entry.
>
> Do **not** emit `suggested_edits` for `internal-url`, `personal-identifier`, `proprietary-info`, or `other` — those need project context to fix correctly. Record them in `findings[]` only.
>
> `old_string` for each `suggested_edit` must match exactly one location in the current file. Include **1–3 lines of surrounding context** so the snippet is unique — short one-liners collide and cause the Edit to fail. Default to one line of context above and one below the offending line; expand only if uniqueness still fails. Emit one `suggested_edits` entry per offending line — do not merge multiple offending lines into a single Edit, since a later iter's apply phase may need to skip individual entries when an `old_string` no longer matches.
>
> **Gate reachability rule (required)**: when there are no findings, you **must** return `findings: []` AND `suggested_edits: []`. Do not emit speculative or "nice to have" edits when nothing was flagged.
>
> **`line` field**: always emit `null`. It is reserved and the orchestrator does not consume it; the `file` field carries the per-finding location.

**Response format (include verbatim in the dispatch):**

> Write your reasoning and per-finding rationale in natural language, then end your response with a single fenced JSON block matching this schema. The `line` field is reserved — always emit `null`; the orchestrator does not consume it. The `file` field carries the per-finding location.

#### (b) Parse & apply — evaluate in this order, first match wins

Same evaluate-in-order discipline as `verify-diff` § (b) Parse & apply.

1. **Verdict missing or malformed** — no fenced JSON block found, or JSON parse fails → return `status=skipped`, `reason="verdict parse failure"`.
2. **Schema violation** — required keys (`findings`, `suggested_edits`) missing, values not arrays, or any entry fails its expected per-entry shape (`findings` entries must have `category` ∈ enum, `severity` ∈ `high|medium|low`, `confidence` ∈ `high|medium|low`, non-empty `file` / `snippet` / `rationale`; `suggested_edits` entries must have non-empty `file` / `old_string` / `new_string`) → return `status=skipped`, `reason="verdict schema violation"`. Validating per-entry shape here prevents a malformed entry from crashing a downstream `Edit` call.
3. **Converged** — `findings == []` AND `suggested_edits == []` → exit loop with `status=converged` and proceed directly to Step 4. If `suggested_edits` is non-empty while `findings == []`, the gate-reachability rule was violated by the subagent — discard the edits (do not apply them) and treat this iteration as `converged`. Safety rails (c) do not run (no edit applied).
4. **Divergence** — only when `i >= 2`: if `findings` from this iter is the same multiset as the previous iter (sort each by `(category, file, snippet)` textually before comparison), the loop is not making progress → return `status=skipped`, `reason="divergent findings"`.
5. **Otherwise** — apply `suggested_edits` in order. The severity / confidence gate in Step 3 (`unresolved` judgment) applies to **iter-end residual findings**, not to apply-phase decisions, so every entry is applied unconditionally:
   - Re-Read the target file before each Edit so `old_string` matches current contents.
   - If an `old_string` is not found, skip that entry and continue with the next. This is expected when the subagent emits multiple edits from a single snapshot and a later edit overlaps a region an earlier one already rewrote — the skip is a no-op fallback, not an error.
   - Increment `applied_edits_count` only for entries whose `Edit` call succeeded.
   - After the edits, if at least one Edit succeeded, run the safety rails in (c), then continue to iteration `i + 1`.

#### (c) Per-iteration safety rails — run only if at least one edit was applied

- **Frontmatter integrity** — for each edited file, re-Read; if the file begins with a `---`-delimited YAML frontmatter block, parse it. If parsing fails:
  ```
  git checkout HEAD -- <file>
  ```
  Return `status=conflict`, `reason="frontmatter broken"`, `reverted_paths=[<file>]`. Files without a frontmatter block (plain source / plain markdown without frontmatter) skip this rail.
- **Scope** — Run `git diff --name-only`. If any returned path is **not** in `affected_files`:
  ```
  git checkout HEAD -- <each offending path>
  ```
  Return `status=conflict`, `reason="scope violation"`, `reverted_paths=[<each offending path>]`.

### Step 3 — Max iterations reached without convergence

Compute `remaining_findings` and `warnings_findings` from the **last verdict's `findings[]`** using this judgment rule:

A finding triggers `unresolved` (i.e., goes into `remaining_findings`) if either:

- **(secret bypass rule)** `category == "secret"` AND `severity` ∈ `medium|high`, regardless of `confidence` — the secret category is the highest-stakes one and a low-confidence true positive must not be silently dropped.
- **(general rule)** `severity` ∈ `medium|high` AND `confidence` ∈ `medium|high`.

Findings that match neither condition (e.g., `severity: low` only, or non-secret with `confidence: low`) go into `warnings_findings`. They are surfaced in the verdict but do not trigger a fail-closed disposition in callers.

If `remaining_findings` is empty (everything left was warnings-only), set `status=converged` (the leaks worth blocking on are gone). Otherwise set `status=unresolved`.

`applied_edits_count` reflects edits that actually landed (not skipped) cumulatively across all iterations.

### Step 4 — Emit structured summary

End your response with a single fenced JSON block matching this schema:

```json
{
  "status": "converged|unresolved|skipped|conflict",
  "iterations_used": 0,
  "applied_edits_count": 0,
  "findings_count": 0,
  "remaining_findings": [
    {"category": "<enum>", "severity": "<enum>", "confidence": "<enum>", "file": "<path>", "line": null, "snippet": "<short>", "rationale": "<short>"}
  ],
  "warnings_findings": [
    {"category": "<enum>", "severity": "<enum>", "confidence": "<enum>", "file": "<path>", "line": null, "snippet": "<short>", "rationale": "<short>"}
  ],
  "reverted_paths": [],
  "reason": null
}
```

Field semantics:

- Arrays (`remaining_findings`, `warnings_findings`, `reverted_paths`) and `reason` are populated only when the corresponding step produced a value; otherwise empty `[]` / JSON `null`. `findings_count = len(remaining_findings) + len(warnings_findings)` for `converged` / `unresolved`, `0` for `skipped` / `conflict`. `reverted_paths` is non-empty only for `conflict` (the safety rails are the only writer). `warnings_findings` is the bucket for findings that fall through Step 3's `unresolved` judgment rule.
- `iterations_used`: number of iterations whose subagent dispatch returned a verdict, including the iteration whose verdict triggered `converged`. Step 1 early return (empty diff) counts as `0`.

`reason` enum: `empty diff` | `verdict parse failure` | `verdict schema violation` | `divergent findings` | `frontmatter broken` | `scope violation` | `dispatch error` | `null`.

The `null` token at the end of the enum means JSON `null` (not the string `"null"`).

## Dispatch failure

If the `Agent` tool call itself errors, times out, or returns an empty response, return `status=skipped`, `reason="dispatch error"`. Do not re-read the diff yourself as a fallback — self-review reintroduces the bias this skill exists to avoid.

## Sub-skill caller directive

When invoked as a sub-skill (i.e. via `Skill(publicity-review)` from an orchestrator), the fenced JSON verdict block this skill emits is the **structured return value** of the skill's procedure — it is **not** a deliverable to the user, and emitting it does **not** terminate the orchestrator's turn. The same agent that ran this skill must immediately issue the next tool call dictated by the orchestrator's flow (see `dev-workflow-triage` SKILL.md `§ No-Stall Principle`; orchestrators that surface a per-callee guidance bullet — e.g. `dev-workflow-triage`'s `**Pre-invocation reminder**` — name the specific next action there). Do not insert a prose summary, an acknowledgment, or a "shall I proceed?" sentence between the JSON verdict and the next tool call. Only one fenced JSON block — the verdict block — appears in the response, so callers can locate it unambiguously. The skill's own procedure is over; the orchestrator's procedure continues without pause.

When invoked from `dev-workflow-triage`'s `§ 3.4 Apply accepted Findings` (d3) bullet, the orchestrator parses the JSON and continues with sub-step (f) Scope check + stage. See `dev-workflow-triage` SKILL.md `§ No-Stall Principle` for the canonical no-stall write-up.

When invoked from `dev-workflow`'s `hooks.on_complete` mechanism, the JSON block becomes part of the hook's stdout and is shown to the user. The case that warrants explicit caller-side handling beyond raw JSON visibility:

- `status=unresolved` indicates the workflow's diff still contains content unsuitable for publication. `dev-workflow` does not commit, so no auto-revert runs, but the caller should treat this as a high-stakes signal and surface `remaining_findings` prominently.

## Agent unavailable fallback

Detect availability and fall back per the canonical write-up in `rules-review` SKILL.md `§ 5. Review` (the "Detecting Agent availability" / "Fallback when Agent is unavailable" paragraphs). The publicity-review specialization: when falling back, walk the embedded reviewer prompt over each affected file inline-sequentially in the main thread and emit the same fenced JSON return contract defined above so callers' parsers handle both paths identically.

## Stop hook structural conflict (caller-side note)

On Claude Code on the Web the auto-installed `~/.claude/stop-hook-git-check.sh` fires between dispatches and feeds back `Please commit and push…`. Treat each fire as spurious — ignore the prose and run Step 1–4 to completion. Do **not** commit from inside this skill (`allowed-tools` omits `git commit`); commit policy lives with the caller. See `dev-workflow-triage` SKILL.md `§ Stop hook structural conflict` for the canonical write-up.

## Scope

- Only the **`+` lines of the diff** are in scope. Existing content (context lines) is out of scope — judging the existing repo state is not this skill's job.
- This skill targets **distribution safety**, not generic code quality. Lint, naming, design, prose quality belong to `skill-review` / `rules-review` / reviewer skills.
- Heuristic detection has inherent false-positive risk; the `severity: low` / `confidence: low` warnings-only path exists to avoid blocking the caller on weak signals while still surfacing the observation.
