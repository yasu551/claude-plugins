# Test Runner

This project is a Claude Code plugins marketplace. "Tests" here means verifying the repository structure, version consistency, JSON syntax, and SKILL.md/agent frontmatter validity — equivalent to the `/verify-plugins` command logic.

## Process

1. Determine test scope:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--base-commit <sha>`: run `git diff --name-only <sha>` to get changed files (includes committed, staged, and unstaged changes)
   - Otherwise: run `git diff --name-only HEAD` to detect changed files (if HEAD is unavailable or no changed files detected, run full verification)
   - This marketplace is small and structural; any change touching `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `plugins/**`, `skills/**`, or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` should trigger full verification. If only unrelated files (e.g. `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/**`) changed, still run full verification — it is fast
2. Spawn a subagent (Agent tool, subagent_type: `general-purpose`) to execute verification
3. Return the subagent's structured summary to the caller

## Subagent Instructions

> Verify this Claude Code plugins marketplace repository. Perform the following checks and return a structured summary.
>
> ### Checks
>
> 1. **Load marketplace manifest**: Read `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Extract the `plugins` array. For each plugin, capture `name`, `source`, `skills` (optional), and `version`.
>
> 2. **Skill entity existence**: Verify each `skills/*/` directory contains `SKILL.md`.
>
> 3. **Plugin source directory structure**: For each plugin in marketplace.json, dispatch by `source` prefix:
>    - **If `source` starts with `./skills/`** (direct-skill plugin): verify `<source>/SKILL.md` exists and `skills: ["./"]` is present
>    - **If `source` starts with `./plugins/`** (wrapper plugin): verify `<source>/` exists; if `<source>/skills/` exists, each entry under it must be a symlink (use `readlink`) resolving to an existing `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`; if `<source>/agents/` exists, each `.md` file must have YAML frontmatter; if `<source>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists, its JSON must be valid
>    - **Additionally, for wrapper bundles** (wrapper plugin with `skills` array of specific paths like `./skills/<name>`): verify each path in `skills` array resolves to an existing `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, AND verify the set of paths matches the set of symlinks under `<source>/skills/` (each symlink has a corresponding `skills` entry, and vice versa — detect drift in either direction)
>
> 4. **Version consistency**: For each plugin, if `<source>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists (only possible for `./plugins/` sources), verify its `version` matches marketplace.json.
>
> 5. **JSON syntax**: Validate `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and every `plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `jq empty`.
>
> 6. **Frontmatter presence**: Verify each `skills/*/SKILL.md` and each agent file (`plugins/*/agents/*.md`) starts with `---` on the first line (YAML frontmatter).
>
> ### Return Format
>
> Return a structured summary with one of three statuses:
>
> **Status: SUCCESS**
> - All checks passed
> - Per-check summary: counts (e.g., "15 skills verified, 13 plugins, 0 version mismatches")
>
> **Status: TEST_FAILED**
> - Per-check results with failures highlighted
> - For each failure:
>   - The specific check that failed
>   - File path and what was expected vs actual
>   - Remediation hint (e.g., "recreate symlink", "bump version in plugin.json")
> - Keep the summary concise but include enough detail to fix without re-running
>
> **Status: EXECUTION_ERROR**
> - Command that failed to execute (e.g., `jq` missing, marketplace.json unreadable)
> - Error output
> - This status is for infrastructure/environment errors, not verification failures
